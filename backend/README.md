# Capstone Backend
This is my RESTFUL JSON API. Within this directory (backend), there are helper function files, test files, config files, and more. Please read the config file, the sql functions use variables from them.

## Running Tests
Make sure the Postgresql server is running, but the app server does not have to be running. Then navigate to the directory the test file is in, and run:
```
npm run test filen_name
```
Or, from the backend directory run:
```
npm run test
```

# API and App Keys
This app uses JSON Web Tokens so make sure to make your own keys!
