# Capstone: Savour
Build a database driven website. This website will be powered either off of an external API or an API the developer builds themselves. The website will incorporate all of the full stack skills the developer has developed. The developer should implement unique features to the website to make it stand out.

## Schemas
```
https://github.com/git-pok/capstone.git
```

## Visit The Working App At
```
https://savour-xlpj.onrender.com/login
```
You may try the app at the link above. A user may register, log in, and try all features. However, the database expires on Oct 12, 2023, and this will prevent the app from working.

## Running Tests
All tests work and run correctly. Please read README.md files
in frontend and backend directories for instructions.

For frontend tests, please note
```
/src/__tests__/SavourApp.test.js.
```
Within this file there is a username and password for the username: testUsr. This data exists in the
database I have but might not in yours. You may
create this exact test data or replace it with
new data. Sign up a user or insert a user
into the database. And unless a test database
is configured, this test user data will remain in the database; so remeber it's in the database
unless one deletes!
