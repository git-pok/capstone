# Capstone: Savour
Build a database driven website. This website will be powered either off of an external API or an API the developer builds themselves. The website will incorporate all of the full stack skills the developer has developed. The developer should implement unique features to the website to make it stand out.

## Schemas
```
https://github.com/git-pok/capstone.git
```

## Visit The Working App At
```
https://savour-xlpj.onrender.com/login
```
You may try the app at the link above. A user may register, log in, and try all features. However, the database expires on Oct 12, 2023, and this will prevent the app from working.

## Running Tests
All tests work and run correctly. Please read README.md files
in frontend and backend directories for instructions.
As of now, for frontend tests, please not SavourApp.test.js.
Within the tests within this file there is a username and password for the username: testUsr. This data exists in my
database but not yours if you clone the repository.
To fix this, create test data that will exist in the database
and will replace this. To do this one must sign up a user. I
ran out of time to do this!
