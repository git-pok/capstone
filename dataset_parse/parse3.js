Cover the tin with foil and bake in the oven for 1 hr 40 mins, taking off the foil for the last 15 mins. Once the meatloaf has been cooking for 1 hr, tip the peppers, courgettes and red onion into a roasting tin and toss with the oil.

Take the meatloaf and roasted veg from the oven, leave the loaf to settle for 5 mins, then tip out onto a platter or board, remove the baking parchment and scatter with dill if using. Toss the roasted veg with the vinegar, garlic and mint and serve them with the meat loaf.",

Fry the onions in the pan over a low heat for about 8 mins until soft and golden, then add the garlic and cook for 1 min more. Working fast, add the meat and juices, the spice mix, tomato purée, peanut butter and coffee to the pan and cook for 2-3 mins, stirring to coat the meat until everything is thick and gloopy, then pour in the vinegar and stock.

Take the casserole out of the oven, put back on the stove and remove the lid. Simmer the sauce for 5 mins, then stir in the semolina flour and simmer for 2-3 mins more. Finely grate over the chocolate, stir through with the beans and simmer for a minute more to heat through. Fish out the chillies, then leave everything to rest for at least 15 mins. Bring the pan to the table. Serve with bowls of accompaniments and the chilli paste (see tip below) to add heat.",

      "plain boiled long grain rice, to serve"
    ],
    "steps": "Prepare your vegetables. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice. Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves. Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob). Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent. Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin. Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince. Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew. Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture. Add a 400g can of chopped tomatoes. Tip in ½ tsp dried marjoram, 1 tsp sugar and add a good shake of salt and pepper. Squirt in about 2 tbsp tomato purée and stir the sauce well. Simmer it gently. Bring the whole thing to the boil, give it a good stir and put a lid on the pan. Turn down the heat until it is gently bubbling and leave it for 20 minutes. Check on the pan occasionally to stir it and make sure the sauce doesn’t catch on the bottom of the pan or isn’t drying out. If it is, add a couple of tablespoons of water and make sure that the heat really is low enough. After simmering gently, the saucy mince mixture should look thick, moist and juicy. Drain and rinse a 410g can of red kidney beans in a sieve and stir them into the chilli pot. Bring to the boil again, and gently bubble without the lid for another 10 minutes, adding a little more water if it looks too dry. Taste a bit of the chilli and season. It will probably take a lot more seasoning than you think. Now replace the lid, turn off the heat and leave your chilli to stand for 10 minutes before serving. This is really important as it allows the flavours to mingle. Serve with soured cream and plain boiled long grain rice.",

Set aside to cool on a plate, then peel off the charred skin and remove the stem. Roughly chop the flesh and set aside. In a large pan, heat the oil, add the onion and carrots with a pinch of salt, and fry over a low-medium heat for 15-20 mins until the carrots have softened. Add the aubergine, both types of lentils, the kidney beans with the liquid from the can, soy sauce, tomatoes, chocolate, chilli powder, oregano and the spices. Stir to combine, then pour in the stock. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat to very low. Cover with a lid and cook for 1½ hrs, checking and stirring every 15-20 mins to prevent it from burning. Remove the lid and let the mixture simmer over a low-medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 15 mins until you get a thick sauce. Stir in the lime juice and taste for seasoning – add more salt if needed. Serve hot over rice with whichever accompaniments you want!",

Return the chicken to the sauce, add the chocolate and continue cooking, uncovered, for 30 mins more. If the sauce looks like it’s getting a little too thick, add some of the chilli soaking liquid or some water. Cook the rice following pack instructions. Meanwhile, put the red onion in a small bowl. Add the lime juice and a pinch of salt. Leave to pickle until ready to serve. When the rice is cooked, add the coriander and lime zest and juice, and fluff up with a fork.

You can add a tablespoon of flour if you need to thicken it a little. Place a large, non-stick pan over a high heat with 2 tbsp vegetable oil. Ladle the pancake mix into the pan. Use the back of the ladle to smooth the mixture out to create a thin, even layer. Reduce the heat to medium high. Fry for 2-3 mins, until air bubbles start to pop on the surface and the sides start to crisp. Flip the pancake then slightly lift the side of the pancake with a spatula and add another tablespoon of oil underneath – shake the pan a little to make sure the oil coats the bottom of the pancake. Use a spatula to press on top of the pancake to ensure the pancake is crispy. Fry for a further 2 mins. Flip one last time, pressing down on the pancake again and fry for 30 seconds. Drain on kitchen paper and keep warm in a low oven while you cook the second pancake using the same method. Serve (optionally cut into bite sized pieces).",

Lift out with tongs into a colander, keeping the cooking water to boil the pasta. Run cold water over the kale, squeeze out any excess water, then transfer to a food processor. Add the oil, garlic, lemon juice and 1 tsp salt, then blitz to a fine pesto. Season to taste and transfer to a small pan. Gently warm over a medium-low heat. Clean the food processor. For the goat’s cheese paste, tip in the nuts, sage, goat’s cheese, a good squeeze of lemon juice and the oil, then blitz to a paste. Season, then warm in another small pan over a medium-low heat, stirring occasionally. Bring the pan of cavolo water to the boil again, adding more water if needed. Add the pasta sheets and simmer following pack instructions. Drain, keeping back a cup of the pasta water to add to the sauce (about 400ml). Cut the pasta sheets in half and toss in a little olive oil. Stir the reserved pasta water through the cavolo sauce and keep on a low heat. If the sauce looks thick, thin down with a little more water, or increase the heat a little if too thin; it should be pourable like double cream. Spoon a pool of sauce onto each plate. Layer the lasagne sheets on top with spoonfuls of the goat’s cheese paste in-between each layer. Top with the last sheet of pasta and ladle over a little more sauce, then scatter over the cheese.

    "steps": "Put a large saucepan of water on to boil. Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together. Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside. Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked). Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it. While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic. Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard. Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet. Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later. Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated. Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed. Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.",

Cook the macaroni according to pack instructions until just soft, but still with a little bite (this is called al dente in Italian). This will take about 10 mins. Drain in a colander, then run under the tap and stir to stop the pasta sticking together. Make a roux: (A roux is simply flour and fat, cooked together, then used to thicken sauces.) Heat oven to 190C/ fan 170C/gas 5 and butter a 25 x 18cm ovenproof dish. Melt the butter in the medium pan. When foaming, add the flour, then cook, stirring constantly, for 1 min on a low heat. Finish the sauce: Slowly stir the warm infused milk into the roux until smooth. Simmer for 3-4 mins, stirring often, until the sauce has thickened and has a coating consistency (run your finger through the sauce on a spoon – it should leave a trail). Remove the pan from the heat, then add the cheddar and mustard powder. Season, then stir until the cheese has melted. Assemble and bake: Mix the cheesesauce through the macaroni to coat it well, then tip into the prepared dish. Sprinkle the Parmesan and breadcrumbs over the top, then bake for 15-20 mins until golden brown and bubbling. Serve piping hot on its own or with a green salad.

    "steps": "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Scatter the nuts over a baking tray and cook for 5 mins until toasty and golden. Leave to cool, then chop. Turn the oven down low if you want to keep the whole batch of pancakes warm, although I think they are best enjoyed straight from the pan. Put the tofu, vanilla, lemon juice and 200ml of the milk into a deep jug or bowl. Using a stick blender, blend together until liquid, then keep going until it turns thick and smooth, like yogurt. Stir in the oil and the rest of the milk to loosen the mixture. Put the dry ingredients and 1 tsp salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine and aerate. If there are any lumps in the sugar, squish them with your fingers. Make a well in the centre, pour in the tofu mix and bring together to make a thick batter. Heat a large (ideally non-stick) frying pan and swirl around 1 tsp oil. For golden pancakes that don’t stick, the pan and oil should be hot enough to get an enthusiastic sizzle on contact with the batter, but not so hot that it scorches it. Test a drop. Using a ladle or large serving spoon, drop in 3 spoonfuls of batter, easing it out gently in the pan to make pancakes that are about 12cm across. Cook for 2 mins on the first side or until bubbles pop over most of the surface. Loosen with a palette knife, then flip over the pancakes and cook for 1 min more or until puffed up and firm. Transfer to the oven to keep warm, if you need to, but don’t stack the pancakes too closely. Cook the rest of the batter, using a little more oil each time. Serve warm with sliced banana, berries, toasted nuts and a good drizzle of maple syrup or honey.",

Bake for 20-25 mins until risen and golden. Mix the reserved caster sugar with the lemon juice. When the muffins are done, remove from the oven, then brush with the sugar and lemon mixture while they are still hot. Gently loosen the edges of each muffin with a knife, then leave in the tin for 15 mins to cool a little as they’re very delicate while hot. Remove to a wire rack. Best eaten the day of making, but will keep for up to 2 days.",

Mix the flour, nutmeg and baking powder together, then add to the food processor and blitz to combine. Pour in 250ml milk and blitz for another 1-2 mins until a batter forms. If you prefer thinner pancakes, add another 50ml milk. Pour the batter into a jug or bowl. Mix the yogurt with the harissa in a small bowl to taste. Set aside. Return the pan to a medium-low heat. When the residual butter in the pan is sizzling, pour in a ladleful of batter and cook for 2 mins until the top of the pancake is nearly set. Flip and cook for another 1 min until cooked and lightly golden. Transfer to a baking tray inside a low oven to keep warm. Repeat with the rest of the batter, making four to six pancakes. Crack the remaining eggs into ramekins. Bring a pan of water to a simmer, add a drop of vinegar and stir to create a gentle whirlpool. Tip in one egg and cook for 3-4 mins until the white is set. Lift onto kitchen paper to drain using a slotted spoon. Repeat with the remaining egg. Top the pancakes with the harissa yogurt, poached eggs and a sprinkling of nigella seeds, if you like.",

While still whisking, pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream. Heat the pan over a moderate heat, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper. Ladle some batter into the pan, tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter into the mixing bowl, return the pan to the heat. Leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 30 secs. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn. Hold the pan handle, ease a palette knife under the pancake, then quickly lift and flip it over. Make sure the pancake is lying flat against the base of the pan with no folds, then cook for another 30 secs before turning out onto a warm plate. Continue with the rest of the batter, serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate. You can freeze the pancakes for 1 month, wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead.",

Heat a small non-stick frying pan with a knob of butter. When the butter starts to foam, pour a small amount of the mixture into the pan and swirl around to coat the base – you want a thin layer. Cook for a few mins until golden brown on the bottom, then turn over and cook until golden on the the other side. Repeat until you have used all the mixture, stirring the mixture between pancakes and adding more butter for frying as necessary.

Cook until warmed through, crushing gently with the back of your wooden spoon, then set aside. The best way to make the guacamole is with a large stone pestle and mortar, but you can use a medium bowl and a flat-ended rolling pin instead. Crush the garlic, coriander and chilli into a rough paste. Scoop in the avocado with a little salt and crush roughly – you want it chunky, not smooth. Squeeze in the lime juice and set aside. Mix the salsa ingredients in a small bowl. Heat a griddle pan or steamer and quickly griddle the tortillas or steam a stack of them to warm up. Reheat the bean mixture. To serve, put 1-2 heaped tbsp of beans on a tortilla. Top with a big spoonful of guacamole and some salsa, hot sauce and a dollop of soured cream or yogurt.",

Cover and chill for at least 30 mins. Will keep chilled for two days. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6. Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured surface to roughly the thickness of a £1 coin, and use to line a 23cm fluted tart tin, leaving some overhanging. Line with a disc of baking parchment big enough to cover the edges, and fill with some baking beans to weigh it down (use dried rice or lentils if you don’t have baking beans). Bake for 15 mins, then remove the parchment and beans and bake for 10-15 mins more until the pastry is biscuity. Trim away any overhanging pastry with a serrated knife. Set aside to cool. Meanwhile, set aside four of the apples, then peel, core and roughly chop the rest. Put them in a shallow saucepan with 2 tbsp water, all but 1 tbsp of the sugar and the alcohol, if using. Cover and cook over a low heat for 25-30 mins, stirring occasionally and adding more water if needed, until the apples have collapsed into a purée. Taste the mixture and sweeten with more sugar, if needed. Turn the oven up to 210C/190C fan/gas 8. Peel, core and halve the reserved apples, then cut into even sized slices. Spread the apple purée over the base of the tart case, then arrange the apple slices in neat, concentric circles, starting from the outside. Brush the apples with butter, then scatter over the reserved sugar and bake for another 20-25 mins until golden. Mix the jam with 1 tbsp hot water from a freshly boiled kettle. When the tart has finished baking, glaze generously with the jam, then leave to cool a little. Serve warm or cold, dusted with icing sugar, if you like.",

      "10cm piece of cucumber",

    ],
    "steps": "Cut the potatoes into 1cm-thick chips – leave the skin on, or peel first, if you prefer. Tip into a pan of cold salted water and set aside while you make the flatbreads. Mix the yogurt and flour with a pinch of salt to make a soft dough. If it feels too sticky, add a little more flour. Knead gently for a minute or two until smooth and elastic, then divide into four pieces. Cover with a clean tea towel and set aside. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Bring the pan of chips to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 8-10 mins until the potatoes start to soften – you should be able to easily break a chip in half. Drain and leave to steam-dry in the colander for 5 mins. Drizzle a large baking tray with the veg oil and put in the oven for a few minutes to heat up. Carefully tip the chips into the tray of hot oil, season with salt and scatter with the za’atar and oregano. Use a fish slice to carefully turn the chips in the oil until well-coated, then bake for 25-30 mins, shaking the tray every 10 mins until crisp. Meanwhile, mix the ingredients for the tzatziki together, and chill until ready to serve. Will keep covered and chilled for a day. Flour a work surface and roll out each piece of dough into a roughly 25cm round. Heat a frying pan over a medium heat and cook each for 2-3 mins on each side until puffed up and golden in spots. Wrap in foil and keep warm in a low oven. Tip the chopped tomatoes and cucumber triangles into individual bowls and set aside. Squeeze half the lemon over the red onions and season with a little salt, scrunch together and set aside. Cut the remaining lemon half into wedges. Slice each halloumi block into eight pieces. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat and cook the halloumi for 1-2 mins on each side until soft and golden. Generously spread each flatbread with the tzatziki, then top with a handful of the chips, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions and halloumi. Squeeze over a lemon wedge, then wrap up and serve with extra chips and tzatziki on the side.",

Keep adding stock until it’s all been used and the rice is just cooked, then stir through the broad beans. While the rice is cooking, heat the remaining oil in a frying pan. Season the chicken and pan-fry for 3-4 mins each side until lightly browned and just cooked through. Turn the heat off but leave the chicken in the pan to keep warm. Once the risotto is cooked, take off the heat and scatter over the parmesan, the rest of the butter and the parsley leaves. Cover the pan and leave to sit for a few mins.

Put the aubergine on a large plate and carefully remove and discard the skin. Use a knife and fork to finely chop the flesh, which should now be soft and pulpy. Tip into a bowl with the remaining garlic, the yogurt, tahini and some seasoning, and stir well. Heat the griddle or barbecue and cook the lamb for 5 mins, turning once. Meanwhile, mix the beans with the lemon juice, remaining olive oil and the mint leaves. Spoon the aubergine purée onto plates and scatter round the minty beans. Top with the lamb and serve with lemon wedges.",

      "3 boneless lamb breasts (approx 1kg in total, ask your butcher for this)",

      "1 tbsp Dijon mustard",
      "500g duck fat",
      "25g plain flour",

    ],
    "steps": "Heat oven to 140C/120C fan/gas 1. Put the lamb on a chopping board. In a small bowl, mix the garlic, 1 tbsp flaky salt, rosemary and mustard into a paste. Rub on the inside of each lamb breast. Next, stack the breasts on top of each other and roll up the longest side into a sausage shape. Use the butchers string to tie knots along the length of the lamb. In a large, round casserole dish, heat the duck fat. When it reaches 100C on a cooking thermometer, add the lamb (you may need to curl it into the dish). Put the lid on, then cook in the oven for 4 hrs until tender. Remove the dish and leave to cool. Once the fat is cool enough, remove the lamb using two slotted spoons. Reserve the cooled fat as you will need 1 tbsp tomorrow, and save the rest to make roasties. Lay the lamb roll on some cling film, then roll as tight as you can. Chill on a baking tray in the fridge overnight. The next day, heat oven to 180C/ 160C fan/gas 4. Remove the cling film and string, and slice into 6-8 equal portions. On a plate, mix the flour and polenta, and season well. Dip each portion into the mixture. Meanwhile, heat 1 tbsp of duck fat in an ovenproof frying pan. When the pan is hot, add the lamb. Seal each side for 2-3 mins until you get a golden, crispy crust. Sear the sides, then transfer the pan to the oven for 8 mins or until it’s hot in the middle. Remove from the oven and put the lamb on a plate loosely covered with foil. Carefully put the pan back on the hob – you should have a good layer of lamb fat. Add your butter then, once foaming, add the shallots, broad beans and chilli. Stir-fry for 1 min, then add the vinegar and marjoram leaves. Season to taste, then remove from the heat. Serve immediately with the crispy lamb breast and reduced lamb stock.",

Add the yeast and sugar to one side of the bowl, and the salt on the other. Using a spatula, mix everything together to combine. Make a well in the centre and pour in 300ml warm water. Using the spatula, mix until you have a rough dough. Tip the dough out onto the work surface and bring together into a large mound. Knead the dough by hand for 10-15 mins or in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook for 6-8 mins on high speed until smooth and elastic. Oil a large bowl and drop in the dough. Cover and leave to prove somewhere warm for 1 hr until doubled in size. Once the dough has doubled, tip it out onto the work surface and flatten it to remove any air pockets. Sprinkle over the halloumi in an even layer, then the chipotle flakes. Fold the dough over and knead in the cheese and chilli until evenly distributed. Line a large baking tray with baking parchment. Tuck the edges of the dough into the centre until you have a neat dough ball. Transfer this to the tray, seam-side down, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to prove for another hour until doubled in size again. You will know the dough is ready when you poke it with your finger – if it springs back slowly and a small indent remains, it’s ready. Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 7 with a roasting tin on the bottom shelf. Uncover the dough and lightly sieve some flour over it. Cut a cross into the top using the tip of a sharp serrated knife. Put the loaf on its tray into the roasting tin, then pour some hot water into the tin around the tray to create steam while baking. This will give you a crisp crust. Bake for 20-25 mins until the loaf is golden and sounds hollow when you tap the base. Remove from the oven and and leave to cool on a wire rack. Cut into slices and enjoy with lashings of butter.",

Alternatively, warm two at a time for 10 seconds in the microwave (not wrapped in foil), or by holding them directly over a gas flame with a pair of tongs (this will give you flavourful charred edges).

Avoiding the border, prick the pastry all over with a fork, then chill. Increase oven to 200C/180 fan/gas 6. When the garlic is cool enough to handle, squeeze the flesh from the bulbs into a bowl. Add the mustard, remaining oil and some seasoning, and use a fork to mash to a paste.

Knead in the food mixer for about 5 mins, but if making this by hand, tip onto a work surface and knead for about 10 mins. The dough is sticky, but try not to add too much extra flour. Leave in the bowl and cover with a tea towel while you make the topping. There is no need to let the dough prove for a specific time – just let it sit while you get on with the next step. Tip the onions into a non-stick wok and add the oil, 4 tbsp water and balsamic vinegar. Cover with a saucepan lid that sits inside the pan to help the onions soften, then cook for 15 mins, stirring about 3 times and replacing the lid quickly so as not to lose too much moisture. After the time is up, the onions should be golden and all the liquid gone. Tip onto a plate. Add the spinach and garlic to the pan and stir-fry until the spinach has wilted. Take the dough from the bowl and cut in half with an oiled knife, then press each piece into a 25-15 cm oval on a large greased baking sheet with oiled hands. Don’t knead the dough first otherwise it will be too elastic and it will keep shrinking back. Spread with the spinach followed by the onions, then dot with the cheese and scatter with the olives, thyme and sunflower seeds. Bake for 15 mins until golden and the base is cooked through.",

Place the milk and bay leaves in a large saucepan over a gentle heat and bring to the boil. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 15 mins. Discard the bay leaves, add the butter and flour, and return to a low heat. Very gently simmer, stirring continuously with a balloon whisk, for about 6 mins until you get a smooth, thick white sauce. Make sure that you get right into the corners of the pan to stop the sauce from catching or becoming lumpy. Once thickened, transfer the sauce to a large bowl and stir in the mustard powder, cayenne pepper, gruyère and egg yolks until fully combined. In a spotlessly clean bowl and with a clean whisk, beat the egg whites just until peaks begin to form. Carefully fold the egg whites into the cheese sauce in three stages making sure you fold, rather than stir, to keep the egg whites light and airy. Fill the prepared ramekins with the soufflé mix. Top each soufflé with a slice of goat’s cheese, then place on a baking tray. Bake for 20-25 mins or until springy and well risen but cooked through. Leave to cool, then run a knife around the edge of each dish and remove the soufflés. If preparing in advance, place soufflés upside down (for neat presentation), on a tray. Cover tray in cling film. Chill for a few days or freeze for up to 1 month. When ready to re-bake, heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Place the upside-down soufflés in a shallow baking dish, top with the remaining goat’s cheese slices and pour over the cream (this stops them from drying out when baked for the second time). Cook for 8-10 mins until golden. Serve immediately alongside some simply dressed salad.",

Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured surface into a disc that’s roughly 28cm in diameter. Use the rolling pin to lift it over a 23cm tart tin, then drape it over the tin. Use a small ball of pastry scraps to push the pastry into the base and up the side of the tin, leaving the excess to overhang. Chill in the fridge for 20 mins. The tin can be lined and chilled up to a day ahead. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pan over a low-medium heat and cook the onions for 45 mins, seasoning them generously with salt and stirring occasionally until they become sticky and golden. Pour in the cream, then add the nutmeg and stir. Bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Lightly prick the base of the tart all over with a fork, then line with a large circle of baking parchment and fill with baking beans, dried rice or pulses. Bake for 20 mins, then remove the beans and parchment, and bake for 10-15 mins more until light brown. Break off a little of the the overhanging pastry to check that it’s done – it should be cooked through and crumbly. Meanwhile, stir the egg yolks into the onion and cream mixture, and stir in two-thirds of the cheese. Tip into the pastry case, then sprinkle over the rest of the cheese and bake for 20-25 mins, or until just set and golden. Leave to cool completely in the tin, trim the overhang using a serrated knife, then remove from the tin. Sprinkle with chives and more cheese, if you like.

Tip onto a lightly floured work surface and gently knead the mix, taking care not to overwork it, as it will make the scones heavy. Press or lightly roll the dough into an oblong about 20 x 25cm. Spread with the yeast extract mixture and roll up from the longest side to create a tight, fat cylinder. Pat the ends of the cylinder to straighten them, then slice into 8 pinwheels and put on the baking tray, patting them to make flattish rounds. Bake for 12-15 mins until golden and cooked. Leave for a few mins on the tray to allow the cheese centre to harden a little, then transfer to a wire rack to cool. Eat warm or cold. Best eaten on the day they are made.",

Mix with a wooden spoon, then use your hands to bring the mixture together, adding a little extra flour if it feels too sticky or a drizzle of extra water if too dry. Tip onto your work surface and knead the dough for 10 mins, or until it feels soft and springy. Put the dough in a clean, lightly oiled bowl and cover with oiled cling film. Leave somewhere warm to rise for 2 hrs, or until doubled in size. Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Heat the oil in a frying pan and add the bacon. Cook until crisp, then tip onto a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain and cool. Line 8 holes of a muffin tin with squares of baking parchment, or lightly grease with oil. Set aside. Tip the dough out of the bowl onto a lightly floured surface. Knead to knock out the air bubbles, then roll to a large rectangle, roughly 35 x 45cm. Sprinkle half the cheese over the surface and top with the bacon bits, beetroot, then the remaining cheese. Starting from one of the long edges, tightly roll the bread into a long cylinder, then cut into 8 pieces. Pop the bread scrolls, cut-side up, into the muffin tin holes. Cover the whole tin with oiled cling film and leave to rise for 30 mins or until doubled in size. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Uncover scrolls and brush with a little extra oil. Bake for 30 mins until golden brown. Leave to cool on a wire rack for at least 20 mins, then serve warm or eat within 1 day.",

    "steps": "For the pastry, wrap the butter in foil and place in the freezer the night before you need it. Put the ham hocks, bay leaves and peppercorns in a large pan. Cover with water and a lid, and simmer for 3 hrs or until really tender – you may need to top up the water level during cooking. (Alternatively, cook in a slow cooker for 6-8 hrs.) Leave to cool in the liquid, then chill overnight if you have time. To make the pastry, tip the flour into a big bowl with 1/2 tsp salt and the mustard powder. Hold the butter block in the foil (peeling back a little at a time as you need to) and coarsely grate straight into the bowl of flour, dipping the end of the butter into the flour every so often – this helps to stop all the butter clumping together. Grate in the cheese too. Use a cutlery knife to lightly stir together, then stir in 175-200ml cold water to bring the dough together. Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 mins. Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in a pan of boiling water for 8 mins or until just cooked, then drain. Melt the butter in another large pan and add the shallots. Cook gently for 10-15 mins until tender and golden, shaking the pan now and then to roll them around in the butter. While they cook, drain the ham hocks, reserving the cooking liquid – the meat should be nice and tender. Shred with two forks, discarding the fat and bones. When the shallots are tender, scoop them out of the pan and add to the ham. Add the flour and mustard powder to the butter, stirring around the pan to make a paste. Cook for 1-2 mins, then splash in a little of the milk, stirring until smooth. Continue adding the milk, bit by bit, stirring well after each addition, until you have a very thick, smooth sauce. Add enough of the ham’s cooking liquid to thin the sauce to a double cream consistency, about 300ml. Taste and season with pepper – it should be salty enough from the ham stock, but add a little extra if it needs it. Stir in the ham, potatoes, shallots, wholegrain mustard, honey and parsley, then leave to cool. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and place a baking sheet on the middle shelf to heat up. Remove the pastry from the fridge. Divide into 2 balls, one a little larger than the other – keep the smaller one wrapped until later. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the large ball of dough to the thickness of a £1 coin. Use this to line the base of a 23cm metal pie plate or shallow cake tin. Fill with the pie filling, then brush the edges with a little beaten egg. Roll out the remaining pastry, lay over the top, then trim the excess. Crimp the sides of the pie, if you like. Brush with more egg wash and poke 2 steam holes in the top with a sharp knife. Place the pie on the hot baking sheet and bake for 45-50 mins until crisp and golden. Serve piping hot with green veg and gravy, if you like.",

    "steps": "First, make the pastry. Put the flour, mustard powder, ½ tsp salt, the lard and butter in a food processor and pulse until combined. Add 1 egg and pulse again. Add 1 tbsp cold water, if needed, until it forms a short pastry. Knead quickly into a ball, then wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 30 mins. Can be made three days ahead or frozen for two months. Season the steak generously and toss with the flour and mustard powder. Heat half the oil in a large pan. Brown the meat in a few batches, adding more oil as you need to and making sure you don’t overcrowd the pan. Turn the meat only when the underside has a nice dark crust. Transfer the chunks to a plate as you go. Add the bacon to the pan and fry until beginning to crisp. Tip in the carrots, onions and bay leaves and cook for another few mins until the veg is soft. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce and tomato purée for 1 min, scraping the tasty bits from the bottom of the pan, then add the stock, thyme and browned beef. Season, cover the pan and simmer gently for 2½ hrs, stirring now and again to prevent the sauce from sticking, until the beef is tender. Remove the lid for the last 30 mins to thicken the sauce. Alternatively, braise in the oven at 160C/140C fan/gas 3 for the same amount of time. Leave to cool. Can be chilled for up to three days, or frozen for two months. Transfer the beef to a pie dish and crumble the cheese over the top. Place the marrowbone in the centre, nestling it into the meat. Alternatively, use a pie funnel or piping nozzle. Roll out the pastry on a floured worktop until large enough to cover the pie and about ½cm thick. Brush the remaining beaten egg over the edges of the pie dish, drape the pastry over, trim the excess and pinch around the edge to seal. Cut a hole for the marrowbone or pie funnel to poke through, and brush the top all over with beaten egg. Use the pastry trimmings to decorate the pie however you like. Chill for about 30 mins while you heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. If you have any beaten egg left, give the pie a final brush for extra glossiness. Bake for 45-50 mins until the pastry is deep golden.",

    "ingredients": [
      "850g from the long end of a large butternut squash, to give you a solid piece, peeled (you may need to use the ends of 2 squashes)",
      "400g shallots, speeled and halved if large",
      "2 tbsp olive oil",
      "50g pecans",
      "1½ tbsp maple syrup",
      "1½ tbsp balsamic vinegar",
      "500g pack all-butter puff pastry",
      "plain flour, for dusting",
      "1 tbsp chopped sage",
      "200g blue wensleydale cheese, diced (or vegetarian alternative)"
    ],
    "steps": "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Cut the squash lengthways into eight long chunky pieces and put in a large roasting tin with the shallots. Toss in a little oil, season and roast for 20 mins. Add the pecans and roast for 10 mins more, or until the squash is cooked but still firm. Leave the squash to cool completely, but tip the nuts and shallots into a non-stick pan. Add the maple syrup, balsamic vinegar and plenty of seasoning, and stir over the heat until the shallots start to caramelise. Leave to cool. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to a rectangle about 32 x 38cm. Trim 2cm from one of the long edges and set aside. Transfer the pastry to a baking tray. Place 4 of the pieces of squash down the longest length in the middle to make a rectangular block, keeping a generous border of pastry all the way round. Place another 2 pieces of squash on top. Trim the remaining 2 pieces and put crossways at the end. Scatter over the sage and blue cheese, then top with the shallots and pecans. Lightly press to compact everything together. Brush round the pastry edges with the egg, then draw the two long edges up to meet and pinch together to seal – as you would a Cornish pasty. Tuck under the pastry at both ends, then brush all over with egg. Cut leaf shapes from the pastry trimmings and use to decorate the top of the Wellington. Glaze again and make a couple of small air holes with the point of a knife. To freeze: Open-freeze on a baking tray until solid, then wrap in cling film then foil. It will keep for 2 months. To serve, heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and put a baking tray in to heat up. Unwrap the Wellington and place on the hot tray. Bake for 30 mins. Cover lightly with foil and bake for 35-40 mins more, taking off the foil for the final 10 mins. Leave to settle for 10 mins before thickly slicing, or the cheese will be too melty and run out. (If cooking from fresh, chill the Wellington for at least 30 mins before cooking – it then needs only 30-40 mins in the oven.)",

To make the gravy, add the shallot and garlic to the pan juices and cook, stirring, until softened and golden. Pour in the wine, add the herbs and leave to bubble for 2 mins. Pour in the stock and stir in the flour paste, stirring all the time until the gravy has thickened. Cover and cook for 5 mins over a low heat, then strain into a bowl or small freezer container, pushing through as much liquid left in the shallots as you can. Wash the pan, then melt the butter and cook the shallot and garlic until softened. Add the mushrooms and thyme, and fry for 10 mins, stirring frequently, to drive off as much moisture as possible. Season with black pepper and sparingly with salt. Cool. Lay a couple of sheets of cling film on the work surface, side by side and slightly overlapping, then arrange the prosciutto down the centre in two overlapping rows. Spread the mushroom mixture on top, then scatter evenly with the cheese and walnuts. Place the steak on top, then tightly wrap the prosciutto round it, using the cling film to help you. Finally, tightly wrap in the cling film and chill for 30 mins. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface until you think it is large enough to completely wrap round the steak roll. Unwrap the meat, place on top of the pastry and brush round it with the egg mixture. Tightly roll up in the pastry, trimming the excess as you bring the pastry together down the length and ends, sealing well. If you want to add decoration, cut out leaf shapes from the trimmings and use the egg mixture to stick them to the pastry. Chill until ready to cook. Will keep for 2 days. (If freezing, wrap in new cling film, then foil, and freeze along with the gravy and egg glaze. The day before, take everything out of the freezer and put in the fridge, unwrapping the steak roll and covering it loosely with kitchen paper.) Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 with a baking sheet inside. Place the (completely thawed) meat on a piece of baking parchment and brush with the egg glaze. Place on the hot baking sheet and cook for 45-50 mins. Insert a meat thermometer into the centre of the beef: for rare it should be 50C, for medium-rare 55C, and for medium 60C. Cover loosely with foil and leave to rest for 15-20 mins. Trim off the pastry end, then thickly slice and serve with the gravy, heated in a pan, and seasonal vegetables.",

Fold about one-third of the egg whites into the chocolate mix using a large metal spoon, then very gently fold in the rest of the whites until they are evenly mixed in – being careful not to over-mix or you will lose the volume of the mousse.

Return to the oven for 10 minutes or until the juices start to run. Spoon the blackberries and juices over the apples to serve.",

    "steps": "Put the butter in a small saucepan over a medium heat until it foams and turns a nutty brown colour – watch the pan carefully, as butter can burn quickly. Pour into a bowl and set aside to cool. Beat the eggs, sugar and zest in a large bowl with an electric hand whisk for about 5 mins until thick and pale. Add the juice and mix to combine. Mix the flour and baking powder together, then sift over the batter mixture, a third at a time, and fold in. Add a large spoonful of the batter to the butter, mixing together until smooth and combined. Pour this into the batter and gently fold together until fully combined. Press a sheet of cling film onto the surface of the mixture and chill overnight. About 30 mins before you want to bake the madeleines, grease a 12-hole madeleine tin with a little extra butter and dust with a little flour. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and put the tin in the freezer to chill for 30 mins. Remove the batter from the fridge and add about 1 heaped tbsp to each madeleine hole – be careful not to overfill as they will bake over the edge and won’t form the characteristic hump. Depending on the size of your tin, you will have some batter left – either bake in batches or put the rest back in the fridge and bake within three days. Bake in the oven for 10-12 mins or until golden brown around the edges. Immediately turn out the madeleines onto a wire rack and leave to cool fully. Put the chocolate in a microwaveable bowl and heat in the microwave on High in 30 sec bursts until about three-quarters of the chocolate has melted. Remove from the microwave and stir vigorously until the remaining chocolate has melted (this is a simple method of tempering and just ensures the chocolate will set properly at room temperature). Dip each madeleine halfway into the melted chocolate, allowing the excess to drip off, then place on a sheet of baking parchment. As the chocolate starts to set, but while still a little tacky, sprinkle with some of the Blood orange dust (below), if using, and allow to cool.",

Put the sugar in a flameproof 20cm ceramic tatin dish or a 20cm ovenproof heavy-based frying pan and place over a medium-high heat. Cook the sugar for 5-7 mins to a dark amber caramel syrup that’s starting to smoke, then turn off the heat and stir in the 60g diced chilled butter. To assemble the tarte tatin, arrange the apple quarters very tightly in a circle around the edge of the dish first, rounded-side down, then fill in the middle in a similar fashion. Gently press with your hands to ensure there are no gaps. Brush the fruit with the melted butter. Bake in the oven for 30 mins, then remove and place the disc of frozen puff pastry on top – it will quickly defrost. Tuck the edges down the inside of the dish and, with a knife, prick a few holes in the pastry to allow steam to escape. Bake for a further 40-45 mins until the pastry is golden brown and crisp. Allow to cool to room temperature for 1 hr before running a knife around the edge of the dish and inverting it onto a large serving plate that is deep enough to contain the juices.

Alternatively, pulse in a processor until sandy (don’t over-process). Pour the crumb mix over the apples to form a pile in the centre, then use a fork to even out. Gently press the surface with the back of the fork so the crumble holds together and goes crisp, then lightly drag the fork over the top for a decorative finish. Sprinkle 1 tbsp rolled oats and 1 tbsp demerara sugar over evenly, if you wish. Set on a baking tray and put in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, until the top is golden and the apples feel very soft when you insert a small, sharp knife.

Melt the knob of butter in a large frying pan then tip in the apples. Cook over a medium heat, stirring every so often till softened, but not soggy, about 5 mins. Splash in the Pomona and leave to cool. Tip onto a plate to cool more quickly if you like. Using an electric whisk or wooden spoon, beat the softened butter and sugar until creamy and light. Add the eggs a little at a time, beating after each addition, then fold in the flour and almonds. Finally, fold in half of the cooled apples. Spoon the mix into the prepared tin, smooth the top and scatter with the rest of the apples, pressing down lightly into the batter. Bake for 1 hr, until golden and a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. Check the cake after 45 mins, cover with foil if it’s browning too quickly. To make the glaze, warm the jam and Pomona in a small pan until the jam melts. Once the cake is out of the oven, prick it all over with a skewer and drizzle over a little more Pomona. Cool for 10 mins, then turn out of the tin and transfer to a wire rack. Brush the glaze over the apples and serve sliced, with dollops of Pomona cream. Best eaten on the day it’s made, or warmed through the next.",

Season with a small pinch of sea salt flakes and cook for 5-6 mins until the apples have softened and started to caramelise and any juices they have released have evaporated. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool completely. Once cooled, will keep chilled for up to a day. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 with a baking tray inside on the middle shelf. Unravel the pastry on its baking parchment. Spoon the apple mixture over the right side of the pastry, leaving about a 1-2cm border around the edge, then brush the border all around the pastry with some of the beaten egg yolk. Fold the left side of the pastry over the apple filling to enclose it. Crimp or pinch the edge, or use a fork to seal. Use the back of a knife to score six triangles over the top of the pie, and make a few small slits in the centre of each. Brush all over with the rest of the egg yolk, then scatter with the reserved 1 tsp sugar. Carefully lift the pie, still on its parchment, onto the hot baking tray in the oven. Bake for 25-30 mins until puffed up and deeply golden. Leave to cool for 10 mins, then cut into wedges using the marked-out triangles as a guide.",

Add the garlic and chorizo, stir until the oils are released, then stir in the flour. Remove the fish from the milk and set aside the bay leaves. Add the milk to the chorizo pan bit by bit, stirring between additions, until you have a smooth, thick sauce. Stir in the parsley, season and remove from the heat. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Pour half of the sauce into a large casserole dish. Flake the fish into large chunks and scatter over the sauce. Add the prawns and spoon over the rest of the sauce. Stack 5-6 potato slices together and trim off the edges to create a rectangle– don’t worry if it’s not perfect. Continue making stacks of rectangular potatoes until they’re all used up. Scatter the trimmings over the sauce, then arrange the slices on top in a domino pattern, fanning them out to cover the surface. Tuck the reserved bay leaves and four others in among the potatoes, season and drizzle with oil.

Cut in half lengthways so you have two long rectangles, then cut each into five smaller rectangles, so you have 10 in total (they should be 12 x 7cm). Once the spiced apple mixture has cooled, toss with the cornflour. Spoon into the middle of half the pastry rectangles, leaving the remaining five empty. Brush some of the beaten egg over the exposed pastry around the apples, then carefully place the plain pastry rectangles on top of the filling. Press down around the sides so the filling is encased. Crimp the edges using a fork to seal, then use the tip of a knife to lightly cut three lines across the top of the pies so that steam can escape during cooking. Arrange the pies on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment and brush all over with more of the beaten egg. Chill for at least 30 mins in the fridge or 10 mins in the freezer.

Transfer the mould to the fridge while you make the filling. To make the filling, put the sugar in a large saucepan over a medium heat for a few mins until it turns a dark caramel colour – avoid stirring it. Add the butter and stir to combine, being careful as it will steam a little. Add the apples, orange juice, zest and cinnamon, and stir to combine. Cook over a high heat for 5-8 mins until the apple has softened and the liquid has reduced slightly, stirring occasionally. Remove the pudding basin from the fridge and pour the apple filling into it. Cover the top of the filling with the remaining bread and press down the edges of the bread to seal it together. Put the pudding on a baking tray and bake for 35-40 mins, or until golden brown. Leave to cool for 5 mins, then carefully tip upside down onto a serving plate and remove from the basin.

    "steps": "To make the pastry, put the flour, butter and icing sugar in a food processor and pulse until it resembles breadcrumbs. With the motor running, slowly add the egg yolks. If the mixture looks too dry, drizzle in 1-2 tbsp cold water. Tip it out onto your work surface and gently knead together. Flatten the pastry into a disc, wrap in cling film and chill for 20 mins. Meanwhile, make the filling. Pour the milk into a saucepan. Scrape the vanilla seeds from the split pod into the milk and add the pod as well. Heat the milk over a medium heat until it just starts to bubble around the edges. Remove from the heat and leave to cool a little. Beat the egg yolks, sugar and flour together with an electric whisk for 5-10 mins until pale and mousse-like. Remove the vanilla pod from the cooled milk and steadily pour over the beaten egg yolks, whisking constantly. Pour the custard mixture into a clean saucepan. Heat over a medium-low heat, whisking all of the time. Cook the custard for 10 mins, still whisking, until it is very thick. Remove from the heat and push through a sieve into a wide dish. Cover the surface with cling film to prevent the custard from forming a skin. Set aside to cool while you prepare the pastry case. Roll out the pastry between 2 pieces of baking parchment to line a 24cm loose bottomed, fluted tart tin. Cover with cling film and chill for 30 mins. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line the tart case with foil or baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake in the oven for 15 mins. Carefully remove the baking beans and foil, then return to the oven for 5-10 mins until the pastry is golden brown. Leave to cool in the tin on a wire rack while you finish the filling. Reduce oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Gently beat the custard with the ricotta, orange zest and grated chocolate until just combined, and spread evenly in the tart shell. Sprinkle over the pine nuts and bake for 35-40 mins – the filling will still be quite wobbly but it will firm up as it cools. Chill for at least 3 hrs, or overnight. Dust with icing sugar to serve.",

Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks, caster sugar and flours. Pour the hot coconut milk over while whisking continuously. Tip back into the pan and gently heat, stirring constantly, until thickened, smooth and glossy. (At first it will be lumpy, but keep beating and it will become smooth.) Simmer for 2 mins, then take off the heat and stir in the Malibu. Cool with a sheet of cling film laid directly on the surface so a skin doesn’t form. Scrape the caramel into a pan with the chocolate, broken into chunks, and gently melt together. Peel and slice the bananas, then arrange the slices over the base of the pie. Pour over the chocolate caramel and chill again to set – 1 hr at least, or up to 24 hrs. When the coconut cream has gone cold, scrape into a bowl with the double cream and beat until just thick enough to hold a peak. Gently spoon into a plastic food bag (easy to transport) and chill until ready to serve. To serve, snip off the end of the cream bag and pipe all over the pie.

Use the icing to sandwich back together so you end up with 2 x four-layered cakes. Sit the 20cm cake on your serving plate and spread some more icing over the top. Sit the smaller cake on top of that, and completely cover with icing. Decorate with the chocolate buttons. If you want to add some flowers choose something edible, like roses.

Melt in the microwave for 2-3 mins on Medium, stirring halfway through. Stir in the vanilla extract, then sift in the icing sugar. Whip the cream until it just holds its shape, then fold into the melted chocolate. Pour into the prepared tin and smooth the top. Chill for at least 2 hrs or for up to 2 days. Just before serving, remove the tart from the tin and slide it onto a flat plate (loosen edges first with the tip of a small pointed knife). You will find it easier to remove the tart if you leave it at room temperature for 30 mins. Put a few tsps of crème fraîche along the centre of the tart (or around the edges if the tart is circular) and top each with a raspberry, then dust lightly with icing sugar. Cut into thin slices and serve with extra raspberries on the side.",

Chop the tomatoes into small pieces. Stone the avocado, scoop out the soft inside and slice, or if it’s a very ripe avocado you may want to mash it in a bowl with a little lime and salt. Keep all the salad ingredients separate on a board. Heat the grill to high. Line a baking tray with foil and brush with a little oil, place the fish fillets on the tray, pour over any paste from the bowl and brush with a little more oil. Cook the fish close to the grill for 8-10 mins until the fish is cooked and starting to scorch in places, to check its cooked, gently push one of the fillets, it should easily flake when cooked. If you have a gas hob, warm the tortillas directly over the flames with a pair of tongs for a charred finish. Alternatively, wrap in foil and warm in the oven on the shelf beneath the fish. To serve, spread a little soured cream over each warm tortilla, top with a handful of cabbage, some tomatoes and a few slices of avocado. Flake the fish and add a few big chunks to each tortilla then top with coriander, chilli and chilli sauce.",

      "4 tbsp small capers",

    "steps": "Before you start cooking, get everything prepared. Trim each sea bass fillet so they are both the same shape, then score the skin, cutting into the flesh slightly, 5 or 6 times at about 1cm intervals. Set aside. Segment the orange – slice off the top and bottom, then cut away the skin and pith. Cut away each segment, then squeeze out the juice from the rest of the orange into a bowl. Cut the broccoli into medium-size florets. To make the warm broccoli salad, cook the florets in a pan of boiling salted water for 1 min until just cooked. While the broccoli is cooking, put a frying pan on to heat. As soon as the broccoli is cooked, drain it, then tip straight into the hot frying pan to ‘scorch’ out all the moisture. Turn off the heat, then scatter the orange segments over the broccoli. Toss for a few moments just to heat through, then tip into a bowl and dress with the orange juice and 2 tbsp olive oil. Season with pepper and a small sprinkling of sea salt, then set aside. Wipe out the pan. Season the fish with a little salt and pepper just before cooking. Heat the frying pan until very hot, then add 2 tbsp oil. Lay the fish fillets in the pan, skin-side down. As soon as it goes in, press each fillet down with your fingers or a fish slice to stop it from curling up. Reduce the heat to medium, then leave the fish to cook for 3-4 mins, undisturbed, until you can see that the flesh has cooked two-thirds of the way up and the skin is crisp and brown. Flip the fillets over, then fry on the flesh side for about 2 mins until just done, basting the skin with the oil in the pan as it cooks. Leave to rest on a warm plate, skin-side up, and baste with the hot oil and juices from the pan. Pour 2 tbsp olive oil into the pan and place it back on a high heat. Scatter in the capers and anchovies, then cook until they start to crisp. Grate over the lemon zest and squeeze in the juice of ½ the lemon. If there isn’t enough juices in the pan to drizzle over both plates, add a splash more oil. You are now ready to plate up.",

Spoon half of the mash over one dish so it covers everything, making sure it reaches the sides. Rough up the top with a fork and dot with remaining butter. Bake for 30 mins until the top is golden.

Put one disc on a baking tray lined with baking parchment, then spoon the tuna filling into the middle, leaving a small border around the edge. Lay the second on top and crimp the edge to seal.

Stir to release the mussel juices, then pour the contents of the pan into a colander set over a large bowl containing the saffron.

Wipe out the pan and add the rest of the olive oil. Sizzle the chorizo until it releases its oil, then add the onion and garlic and cook until softened. Add the squid and turn over until it turns white. Add the tomatoes and cook down for a minute, then pour over most of the stock, give everything a good stir and bring to the boil. Scatter the rice over the stock, stir well once, then boil vigorously for 5 mins. Reduce the heat to the lowest setting and slowly simmer for 10 mins without stirring until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid. Tuck the prawn tails into the rice and simmer for 5 mins, turning them over until cooked through. Stir through the mussels and broad beans or peas. Taste the rice – if it is still a little raw but the pan is dry, add a splash more stock and continue to cook; if it’s too soupy, then increase the heat to cook off the last of the stock. Once the rice is just cooked, turn off the heat and cover with a tea towel for a few minutes. Scatter over the parsley leaves and lemon zest, then season with smoked salt if you like.

Roll each ball in flour, dust off the excess, then dip in egg. Mix the breadcrumbs with the paprika and roll the balls in the crumbs, until well coated. Chill until you’re ready to fry and serve, or for at least 30 mins to allow the rice balls to firm up. Fill a deep saucepan 3/4 full with oil. Bring up to 180C, or hot enough to brown a chunk of bread in 40 secs. Use a slotted spoon to carefully lower the arancini into the hot oil and cook for 3-4 mins until golden brown, then drain on kitchen paper. Don’t overcrowd the pan or the temperature of the oil will drop. To serve, skewer each arancini with a folded slice of chorizo and an olive.",

Meanwhile, put the paella back in the pan, stir in the remaining fish stock and cook for 2 mins until completely heated through. Stir through a knob of butter,the prawns and shelled mussels. Taste, season with lemon juice, salt and pepper if necessary, and finish with the chopped parsley. Serve with the roast cod, mussels in their shells and steamed purple broccoli or a green vegetable, if you like. Finally, drizzle everything with the saffron dressing.",

Tip the flour, orange zest, mixed spice, carrots, yeast, caster sugar and 1 tsp salt into a large bowl with the eggs, then add the cooled milk mixture and bring together into a sticky dough using your hands. Knead until combined, then tip onto a floured work surface and knead again for 5-10 mins until smooth and springy. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled, large bowl, cover and leave to prove for 1 hr, or until doubled in size. Generously butter a 25cm bundt tin. Melt the remaining butter and leave to cool slightly. Mix the cinnamon, walnuts and brown sugar together in a medium bowl. Separate the proved dough into 40-50 x 25g pieces and roll into balls on a lightly floured surface. Roll the marzipan into small, pea sized balls and set aside. Dunk the dough balls in the melted butter, then roll in the walnut and sugar mixture to coat. Drop the dough balls into the prepared tin, dotting around some of the marzipan balls as you go. Repeat until you’ve used up all the dough balls and marzipan. Cover and prove again for 45 mins until the dough has risen slightly. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Uncover the tin and bake for 40-45 mins, or until well risen and golden. Carefully loosen the bread from the edges using a skewer or butter knife, and leave to cool in the tin for 20 mins. Invert onto a serving plate, keeping the tin in place, and leave for 5-10 mins (the bread will naturally shrink away from the sides), then remove the tin. Gradually whisk the orange juice into the icing sugar to make a thick icing, then drizzle over the bread, letting it drip down the sides. Scatter over the orange zest and serve warm.",

      "2 ½ small oranges, zest of 1 and juice of half",

Cut the beetroots into quarters then toss with 1/2 tbsp oil, the coriander seeds, and some seasoning then pile into the centre of a large sheet of foil and wrap up like a parcel. Bake for 45 mins or until the beetroots are tender then top with the salmon, scatter over half the orange zest and return to the oven for 15 mins. If you want to toast the pumpkin seeds, put them in the oven for 10 mins. Meanwhile cut the peel and pith from 2 oranges then cut out the segments with a sharp knife working over a bowl to catch the juices. Finely grate the garlic and leave for 10 mins to allow the enzymes to activate. Stir the garlic into the orange juice and remaining oil with seasoning to make a dressing. Remove the parcel from the oven and carefully lift off the fish. Tip the beetroot into a bowl with the red onion, remaining orange zest, pumpkin seeds and spinach leaves and toss well. Gently toss through the orange segments and avocado with any beet leaves then pile onto plates and top with the warm salmon. Drizzle over the dressing and serve while still warm.",

Remove the foil and return to the oven for a further 15-20 mins until the garlic has turned golden brown. Meanwhile, make the soup base.

If the soup needs thickening, reduce over a medium heat. When it is the consistency of pouring cream, remove from the heat and set aside, or leave to cool and chill in the fridge until needed. The base of the soup can be made 3 days ahead. Meanwhile, for the paste, pour the Pernod into a small saucepan and add the saffron. Bring to the boil, add the olive oil and warm gently. Take off the heat and leave to cool. When the garlic is golden brown, remove the tray from the oven and squeeze the cloves out into the bowl of a pestle and mortar. Add a large pinch of flaky sea salt and pound to a paste. Slowly add the saffron-infused olive oil, stirring constantly. Transfer to a clean container and chill until needed.

    "steps": "To make the croutons heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Lay the slices of bread on a flat baking tray in a single layer, drizzle with olive oil and bake for 15 mins until golden and crisp. Set aside – can be made a day ahead and kept in an airtight container. Use a layer of the green part of the leek to wrap around and make a herb bundle with the thyme, bay, parsley stalks, orange peel and chilli. Tie everything together with kitchen string and set aside. Heat the oil in a very large casserole dish or stock pot and throw in the onion, sliced leek and fennel and cook for about 10 mins until softened. Stir through the garlic and cook for 2 mins more, then add the herb bundle, tomato purée, star anise, Pernod if using, chopped tomatoes and saffron. Simmer and stir for a minute or two then pour over the fish stock. Season with salt and pepper, bring to a simmer, then add the piece of potato. Bubble everything gently for 30 mins until you have a thin tomatoey soup. When that piece of potato is on the brink of collapse, fish it out and set aside to make the rouille. While the broth is simmering make the rouille by crushing the garlic, chilli and saffron with a pinch of salt in a mortar with a pestle. Mash in the cooked potato to make a sticky paste then whisk in the egg yolk and, very gradually, the olive oil until you make a mayonnaise-like sauce. Stir in the lemon juice and set aside. Once the chunky tomato broth has cooked you have two options: for a rustic bouillabaisse, simply poach your fish in it along with the mussels, if you're using (just until they open) and serve. For a refined version, remove the herb bundle and star anise. Using a handheld or table-top blender, blitz the soup until smooth. Pass the soup through a sieve into a large, clean pan and bring to a gentle simmer. Starting with the densest fish, add the chunks to the broth and cook for 1 min before adding the next type. With the fish we used, the order was: monkfish, John Dory, grey mullet, snapper. When all the fish is in, scatter over the mussels, if using, and simmer everything for about 5 mins until just cooked and the mussels have opened. Use a slotted spoon to carefully scoop the fish and mussels out onto a warmed serving platter, moisten with just a little broth and scatter over the chopped parsley. Bring everything to the table. Some people eat it as two courses, serving the broth with croutons and rouille first, then the fish spooned into the same bowl. Others simply serve it as a fish stew. Whichever way you choose the rouille is there to be stirred into the broth to thicken and give it a kick.",

    "ingredients": [
      "200g bow-shaped pasta, or use your favourite shape",
      "3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil",
      "1 tbsp red wine vinegar",
      "1 tsp dried oregano",
      "16-20  cherry tomatoes",
      "75g olives, pitted (you can use green or black)",

    "steps": "Fill a medium saucepan with hot water from the tap until it’s three-quarters full. Set the pan on the hob. Season the water with a pinch of salt, then turn the heat to medium-high – the water should start to boil after a minute or so. Slowly tip the pasta into the boiling water – do this carefully, as any splashes could burn your skin. Holding the handle of the saucepan with one hand (use a cloth if it’s hot), carefully stir the pasta with a long wooden spoon in the other hand – this will prevent the pasta from sticking together. Set a timer for 10 mins. Stir the pasta every minute or so, and keep checking the heat to make sure the water is gently boiling while the timer counts down. While the pasta cooks, measure 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, 1 tbsp red wine vinegar and 1 tsp dried oregano into a mixing bowl. Season with some salt and black pepper, and mix well – this will make a zingy dressing for the pasta. When the timer beeps, it’s time to check if the pasta is cooked. To do this, scoop one piece of pasta out of the boiling water using the wooden spoon, tip it onto a plate and leave it to cool slightly. Taste the pasta: if it’s soft, it’s cooked through, but if it’s still a little hard in the middle, it needs to cook for a bit longer. Set the timer for another 2 mins, then check again. Place a large colander or sieve in the sink. When the pasta is cooked, turn off the heat and, using two hands, carefully carry the saucepan over to the sink and tip the pasta into the colander to drain away the hot water. Leave to cool for a few minutes in the colander, then tip the pasta into the mixing bowl with the dressing. Mix together until the pasta is coated in the dressing. Put a chopping board on a work surface. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half by pinching each one between your thumb and index finger, and carefully slicing through the middle of the tomato with a small serrated knife. Slice the pitted olives in the same way, then tip all the tomatoes and olives into the pasta. Put the cucumber on the chopping board and cut it in half lengthways. Lay the two halves on the board cut-side down, so they don’t roll around. Cut each piece in half again, so you have four long, chunky pieces. Cut across the cucumber pieces in the other direction so you end up with small cucumber triangles. Tip these into the bowl with the pasta, tomatoes and olives. Put the onion on the board and hold it securely. Cut off the pointy end, then cut the onion in half through the root end. Peel away the papery outer layers until you’re left with just the shiny onion underneath. Lay each onion half on the board, cut-side down so it doesn’t roll around. Holding onto the root end, carefully slice the halves into half-moon shapes, as thinly as you can. Stop when you get to the root. Tip the onions into the bowl. Crumble the feta cheese into small pieces over the bowl, then gently mix everything together until well combined. Eat straightaway, or chill for up to a day before eating.",

    "steps": "To make the bolognese, heat the oil in a wide ovenproof pan over a medium heat. Fry the onion, celery and carrot with some seasoning for 20 mins until soft and lightly golden. Tip in the beef mince, turn up the heat and fry, stirring regularly, for another 10 mins until the mince browns. Add the garlic, fry for a minute, then pour in the wine and bubble for a few mins more, scraping the pan to release any bits. Stir through the purée, bay leaves and tomatoes, with a canful of water. Simmer for 1½ hrs, covered for the first hour, then remove the lid and bubble until the tomatoes have broken down. Season with salt, pepper, the sugar and balsamic vinegar. Tip the pasta shells into a large heatproof bowl with a pinch of salt, and pour over a kettle of boiled water. Cover and leave to soften for 15-20 mins – they need to retain some firmness so you can fill them.  Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 4 and drain the pasta. Use a fork to mash the mascarpone with the mozzarella, chopped basil, garlic and some black pepper in a bowl. The bolognese should be a little wetter than you’d like as the pasta shells will absorb some of the liquid as it bakes. Remove from the heat, giving it a final stir. Using a teaspoon, fill the pasta shells with some of the mascarpone mixture, pressing the mix in with your index finger. Nestle the shells into the sauce, filled-side up. Bake for 20-30 mins until the top is golden and bubbling, and the pasta is tender. Grate over some parmesan and finish with a few basil leaves.",

Simmer gently for 10 mins, then remove the haddock. Flake the flesh and drizzle with the truffle oil and set aside. Mix the butter and flour together to make a paste. Over a low heat, whisk the paste into the hot milk and bring to the boil, stirring all the time. Remove from the heat and add half the grated cheese and stir well. Take the pan off the heat, tip the pasta into the sauce and mix well, then fold through the haddock and season with ground black pepper. The sauce may seem a little thin, but it’ll thicken as it cooks. Butter a large ovenproof dish and tip in all the macaroni (I like it piled high), then finish by scattering over the rest of the cheese and most of the breadcrumbs. This can be prepared a day ahead, covered and kept in the fridge. To cook, heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Bake for 20 mins until bubbling and sprinkle with the rest of the breadcrumbs. Bake for 5 mins more, then drizzle a little more truffle oil on top, and scatter some extra herbs, if you like.",

Drain the pasta, but keep a little liquid in the pan to stop the shells from sticking together. Fish any broken bits of pasta out of the pan and scatter these over the sauce. Line up the shells on top, pushing them down into the sauce so only the tops of the shells are poking out. Fill each shell with the sausage mixture. Scatter with fontina or mozzarella, grate over some extra Parmesan and drizzle with a little truffle oil, if you like. Bake for 30 mins or until golden brown.",

      "20g dried porcini mushrooms",
      "3 tbsp olive oil",
      "4 large sausages, such as Italian or cumberland (if using cumberland, add a pinch of fennel seeds to the meat while cooking)",

      "large handful of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped"

    "steps": "Tip the dried porcini mushrooms into a large pan with 600ml boiling water from the kettle. Set over a low heat and simmer for 10-15 mins until slightly reduced to make an intense mushroom stock. Heat the the oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Squeeze the sausagemeat from the skins into the pan and fry for 5-8 mins, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as it cooks, until lightly browned. Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Drop in the bucatini and move it around using tongs to prevent it sticking together. Cook for 9 mins. Meanwhile, add the garlic and chilli flakes to the sausagemeat and fry for 1 min before pouring in the wine. Cook for 5 mins more until the wine has reduced, then tip in the rehydrated mushrooms and the stock (you should have about 350ml). Season with salt and black pepper, then bring to a simmer. After roughly 9 mins, use the tongs to move the bucatini directly from its cooking water into the mushroom sauce. The mixture will seem quite watery at first, but the trick is to finish cooking the bucatini by simmering it in the broth – it will soak it all up and take on the earthy flavour. Keep moving the pasta in the broth using the tongs for 3 mins, or until most of the water has been absorbed. Stir in the cream, a grating of nutmeg and the parsley. Stir well, taste for seasoning and serve topped with lots of parmesan.",

Aim for 'al dente': cooked, but retaining some bite in the middle. Take a few strands out of the water with a spaghetti spoon or tongs 1-2 mins before the end of the cooking time and bite into it. Repeat until you think it is properly cooked. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a frying pan. When hot, tip in the pancetta. Fry over a medium heat until the fat in the meat has melted down into the pan and the meat has turned lightly golden. Be careful not to crisp the pancetta too much; it will be cooked a little bit more later on in the recipe. Remove from the heat and set aside. Crack two of the eggs into a mixing bowl. Separate the yolk from the third egg: gently crack the side of the shell and, using both hands, slowly open it into two halves over a separate bowl - you want to keep the yolk in one of the halves. Tip the yolk from one shell half to the other and repeat until all the egg white has fallen into the bowl below, taking care not to crack the yolk on any rough shell edges. Tip the yolk in with the other eggs and beat together, along with the double cream, parmesan and some seasoning. Add the garlic to the pancetta and return the frying pan to hob. Fry over high heat for 1 min or until garlic is cooked and pancetta warmed through. Meanwhile, drain the spaghetti. Tip back into the hot saucepan off the heat. Pour egg mixture over pasta, followed by hot pancetta, garlic, any fat and oils. Toss quickly and thoroughly with spaghetti spoon or tongs. Mix until it has thickened to a smooth, creamy sauce.

    "steps": "First, warm your serving dishes in a low oven or in the microwave. Heat the oil gently in a large, shallow pan. Fry the guanciale or pancetta and garlic for 10 mins, or until all the fat has rendered off and the meat is golden and crisp. Remove and discard the garlic clove, then turn off the heat. Bring a large pan of salted water to a simmer and cook the pasta until it’s al dente (about a minute less than the pack instructions). Meanwhile, whisk 2 egg yolks in a small bowl with a pinch of salt. Using kitchen tongs, lift the pasta from the water into the pancetta pan along with any dripping water. Use a wooden spoon to stir it into the rendered fat. If the pan looks dry, add a small ladleful of pasta water and mix it in. Keep adding until you see a little pasta water at the bottom of the pan – you’ll be surprised how much will be absorbed. Working quickly, tip the beaten yolks in with the pasta and stir vigorously. Rinse the yolk bowl out with a little more pasta water and pour that in too. Add most of the parmesan and beat again. If at any time it’s becoming claggy or starting to scramble, pour in a little more water. If you’ve added too much, stir the pasta over the lowest heat for a few moments. You’re aiming for a smooth sauce that is the consistency of double cream. Season with a couple of pinches of ground black pepper and taste for salt. Transfer the pasta to the warmed serving dishes, scatter over the remaining parmesan and nestle the last two egg yolks on top, if using. Season them with some salt and pepper, and drizzle over the truffle oil, if you have it, just before serving.",

Scoop out level dessertspoons of the mix, dip them in the flour and roll them into balls. Heat 3 tbsp of the oil in a large frying pan or wok, then fry the meatballs in batches, browning them on all sides. Set aside on a plate. When you’ve fried all the meatballs, pour away any excess fat. Rinse and dry the pan. Pour the remaining oil into the pan, heat for 1 min then add the remaining garlic and fry for a few seconds. Tip in the tomatoes and break them down with a fork or wooden spoon. Cook over a moderately high heat for 5 mins until jammy. Season with salt, pepper and a little sugar. Tip in the meatballs and turn them over in the sauce, ensuring they’re all covered. Cover the pan and cook the meatballs on a low heat for about 30 mins, spoon over the sauce occasionally and add a little water if it’s becoming too dry. 15 mins before the end of the cooking time, cook the spaghetti. To serve, stir most of the remaining parsley into the sauce then spoon the meatballs and sauce over the spaghetti. Scatter with last of the parsley and serve Parmesan on the side.",

      "1 medium onion",
      "3 tbsp olive oil",
      "2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed",

    "steps": "Using a sharp knife, peel the onion, slice in half through the root and trim off the top. Place the onion, cut-side down, on a chopping board. With your knife parallel to the board, cut 3 slices through the onion, keeping the root intact. With knife point at root end, cut down through the onion, from top to bottom 4 times. Holding the root end, finely slice across the onion (see pic above), to give you small diced pieces. Set a large frying pan over medium heat and when hot, tip in the oil then onion. Cook for 5 mins until starting to soften, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic, cook 2 mins more until the onions start to turn golden. When the onion has softened, tip in the tomatoes and half the basil. Leave to gently bubble for 15 mins until the sauce has thickened and looks pulpy. Stir occasionally and break up any large clumps of tomato with the back of your spoon. Pour water ¾ of the way up your largest pan. Heat over a high heat and add plenty of salt. When water has reached a rolling boil, place the spaghetti into the pan. As it softens, use your hands to push all of it into the water. Give it a stir to separate the pasta, then cook according to pack instructions, about 10 mins. Taste a strand of pasta. It should be just soft, but not mushy. Scoop out a cup of water before draining in a colander (this will help to loosen your sauce). Finishing touches: Tip the drained pasta back into its cooking pan, then pour over the tomato sauce. Give everything a good stir. The sauce should just coat the pasta, if it is thick and looks dry, stir in a few spoons of the pasta water. If it is watery, cook over a low heat until evaporated, stirring often. Use your hands to break the mozzarella into chunky pieces and stir through the pasta along with the remaining basil leaves. Serve straight away.",

If the pan becomes too dry, drizzle in a little more olive oil. Towards the end, continue stirring the mince until it becomes speckled with crisp brown bits. Heat oven to 140C/120C fan/gas 2. While the mince is browning, heat a drizzle more oil in a casserole dish and sizzle the pancetta for 5 mins until it starts to brown and release its fat, then throw in the vegetables and herbs, and finely crumble over the dried porcini. Cook gently for 5 mins until soft and starting to brown. Sprinkle over the sugar, then stir in the tomato purée and splash in the fish sauce and vinegar. Simmer down until gloopy, then stir through the meat and pour in the milk and tomatoes. Rinse out the tomato tins with the wine and stir into the pan. Season, then nestle in the parmesan rind. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook in the oven for 3 hrs. When cooked, tip as many portions of Bolognese as you need into a sauté pan. Cook the pasta until very al dente, then tong into the pan with a bit of the water and finish cooking with the sauce for 2 mins. Stir through the parmesan and a drizzle more olive oil.

Add the oregano, season and bubble for 10-15 mins, stirring occasionally until thickened. To freeze, leave to cool completely, then transfer to a freezerproof container (portion it into more than one, if you like). Will keep frozen for up to three months.

    "steps": "Put the chops in a large bowl with the olive oil, lemon juice, chilli and some black pepper. Turn them with your hands, cover and put in the fridge to marinate for a few hours. Shell the broad beans and cook them in boiling water for 2-3 mins until tender. Drain and rinse in cold water. Slip each bean out of its skin, put them in the bowl of a food processor and add the garlic, mint and anchovy fillets. Remove any fronds from the fennel and set them aside with the tips. Take off any coarse outer layer, split the fennel in half and remove the hard core from each piece. Discard these. Chop the flesh and the reserved fennel trimmings. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a small frying pan and fry the fennel flesh gently for 10 mins until soft. Tip the fennel into the food processor along with the cheese and a little seasoning. Blitz to a purée while pouring in 120ml of the olive oil. Taste and add the lemon juice. You might find you want a bit more olive oil as well, or a little water to produce a thinner consistency. Remember to season again if you add water. Scrape the purée into a bowl and keep covered in the fridge until you’re ready to serve, but let it come to room temperature before you cook the chops. Take the chops out of the fridge and bring to room temperature. Heat a griddle pan over a high heat. Lift the chops out of the marinade and, when the pan is really hot, cook until well coloured on each side, seasoning as you go. Press the meaty bit down so that they get good griddle marks. The chops should be pink in the middle when you serve them – they only take 1½ mins on each side as they’re so small. Do this in batches if you need to. Serve the chops on top of the purée with some mint scattered over, any reserved fennel fonds, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and some lemon wedges on the side.",

Add the melted chocolate and mix all well together until smooth. Divide the mixture equally between the two tins and bake in the oven for about 55 mins - 1 hour. A good way to check that the mixture is equally divided is to put a cocktail stick into each mixture and the levels should be the same. To make the icing, put the butter into a bowl and beat until creamy. Add the icing sugar and cocoa a little at a time beating well between each addition. Add the milk to mix to a soft spreading consistency. To assemble, place the round cake on a large wooden board or tray (the cake will need to served on this). Place the round cake tin on the square cake about 12cm from one edge and cut around the edge of the tin. Remove the smaller piece and place at one end of the round cake to represent the ears. Using the remains of the square cake cut almost in half to give an oblong (for the fence) and a semi circle (for the wings). Place the oblong at the bottom of the owl cake. Slice the semi circle in half horizontally through the middle. Arrange one piece each side of the round cake to make the wings. Spread the butter icing all over the cake. Cut the flake bars into small pieces and arrange on the wings to represent feathers. Keep the flake crumbs. Arrange milk chocolate buttons over the body. Place chocolate fingers on the bottom cake to make the fence. Using a fork, mark the icing to make the owl’s ears. Use the flake crumbs to make a v-shape between the ears like a 'widow’s peak'. Arrange the white chocolate buttons in two circles to make the eyes and place a milk chocolate button in the centre of each. Use a third of the marzipan to shape a beak and use the remaining marzipan to make two feet. Place the candles on the ‘fence’ part of the cake. You can also pipe a child’s name or message on the fence using writing icing.",

Serve with the quinoa, scattering the stew with some coriander leaves just before dishing up and eating with a dollop of yogurt on the side.",

    "steps": "Preheat the oven to fan 180C/ conventional 200C/gas 6. Season the chicken with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then coat lightly in a little of the flour. Heat the oil in a large ovenproof lidded casserole dish and, in batches, brown the chicken on both sides over a high heat. Remove the chicken and set aside. Reduce the heat, add the onions and lardons and cook for about 5-8 minutes so they are golden tinged. Add the garlic, then sprinkle in the plain flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring to prevent sticking. Add the mushrooms, bay leaves, redcurrant sauce and orange zest, then pour in the red wine and stock and season with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, then return the chicken to the casserole dish, making sure it is well covered with the liquid. Put on the lid and cook in the oven for 30 minutes. While the casserole is cooking, prepare the dumplings. Put the self raising flour, breadcrumbs, mustard and butter in a food processor and blitz to a crumb consistency. Add the thyme, parsley, eggs and salt and pepper. Briefly blitz until the mixture forms a fairly moist dough. Using floured hands, roll the dough into 6 large, even sized balls. Remove the casserole from the oven when the 30 minutes is up and sit the dumplings on top. Pop the lid back on and return to the oven for a further 20 minutes, until the casserole is cooked and the dumplings have puffed up. Spoon the chicken and sauce onto six plates and top each with a dumpling. Serve with a rich, fruity red wine. If you want to use a slow cooker, brown the chicken in batches and transfer to the slow cooker pot. Add the flour, onions, lardons, garlic, mushrooms, bay leaves, redcurrant, orange zest, red wine and stock, and season. Cover and cook on High for 4 hours. Make the dumplings according to step 4, then sit on top of the casserole after 4 hours. Cook for another 1-2 hours, then serve.",

Add the peas, sundried tomatoes, pesto and basil to the stew. To make the dumplings, rub the butter into the flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Mix in the grated cheese and add 150ml water, mixing with a cutlery knife to bring the crumbs together to form a light and sticky dough. Break off walnut sized lumps and shape into small balls. Roll the tops of the dumplings in the pine nuts so a few stick to the outside, then place the dumplings on top of the stew and scatter with any remaining nuts. Put the dish in the oven and bake for 25 mins until the dumplings are golden brown and cooked through. Serve with mashed potato and extra veg if you like.",

Remove the chicken and set aside on a plate. Raise the heat, give it a quick stir and, when sizzling, pour in the wine and let it bubble for 2 mins to reduce slightly. Lower the heat to medium, return the prosciutto to the pan, then stir in the tomatoes (breaking them up with your spoon), tomato purée and mushrooms. Spoon 4 tbsp of water into the empty tomato can, swirl it around, then pour it into the pan. Cover and simmer for 15-20 mins or until the sauce has thickened and reduced slightly, then return the chicken to the pan and cook, uncovered, for about 15 mins or until the chicken is cooked through. Season and scatter over the parsley to serve.",

Make a pile of 12 rectangles and cover with a damp tea towel to stop them drying out. Brush 1 of the rectangles lightly with oil. With one of the shortest sides facing you, spoon 1 level tbsp of the filling across the pastry 2cm up from the bottom of the rectangle and around 1cm in from both sides. Form into a sausage shape. Fold in the bottom over the filling, then fold in the 2 long sides all the way up the rectangle. Roll up from the short side close to you, fully enclosing the filling. Place on a baking tray lined with baking parchment. Repeat as above to make a further 11 filo rolls. Brush with more oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds, if using. Can be covered with cling film at this stage and kept in the fridge for up to 8 hrs before baking. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Bake the dippers for 10-15 mins or until the pastry is light golden brown and the filling is cooked thoroughly. Serve with Thai sweet chilli dipping sauce.",

    "steps": "In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, yeast and 1/ 4 tsp salt with 180ml lukewarm water. Knead the mixture for 10 mins or until elastic. Put in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave in a warm place to prove until it has doubled in size, about 1 1/ 2 hrs. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the seasoning ingredients and 1/ 4 tsp salt. In a separate small bowl, mix the cornflour with 2 tbsp cold water and set aside. In a wok over a medium heat, fry the ginger with 1 tbsp rapeseed oil for 30 secs. Add the mushrooms and the seasoning mixture and stir-fry for 1 min. Pour the cornflour paste into the wok and stir-fry for 1 min more, or until the sauce thickens. Add the Chinese cabbage and fry briefly, then remove the wok from the heat. Add the noodles, tofu, spring onions, sweetcorn and sesame oil. Gently fold everything together so that the filling is evenly mixed, then leave to cool. Punch the air out of the dough and divide into 20 small balls about the size of a golf ball, each weighing roughly 25g. Put them in a roasting tin and re-cover with the tea towel. Leave in a warm place to prove for a further 20 mins. Flatten the dough balls with your hands. Use the tip of a rolling pin to roll around the edge of the dough ball a few times to flatten it, then gently work around the edges using your fingertips. The aim is to achieve a round sheet of dough with a thicker bump in the middle on which you can place the filling. Repeat until all of the balls have been rolled. Cover them again with the damp tea towel as you go so they don’t dry out. Taking a dough sheet in the palm of your hand, put 2 tsp of the filling in the middle. Cup your palm so the filling remains in the middle, then gently gather up the edges into the middle and twist to seal. Continue until all the buns are filled. Put them back in the roasting tin and re-cover with the tea towel again Add 1 tbsp rapeseed oil to a frying pan over a medium heat. Arrange half the buns in the pan, leaving 1/ 2 cm between them so they have enough room to rise during cooking. Fry for 1-2 mins, sprinkling with a little water, then pour 100ml water into the pan and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Cook for 2-3 mins until all the water has evaporated and the buns have doubled in size. They should become very white and the bottom should be crispy and golden brown. Repeat the process with the remaining 1 tbsp oil and the rest of the buns. Mix the sriracha and oyster sauce together in a small dish and serve with the buns.",

Transfer the chicken to a plate using a slotted spoon and set aside. Cook the onions and carrots in the pan for 8-10 mins until soft and golden, adding a drizzle more oil if the pan is dry. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for 2 mins more. Stir in the harissa and preserved lemon. Cook for another minute until the vegetables are well coated and sticky. Add the cinnamon and bay leaves, then tip in the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Cook for a few minutes until the liquid has reduced to a thick paste. Tip the chicken and its resting juices back into the pan, and pour over the stock. Stir in the olives and cherries and return to a simmer. Put the lid on and simmer gently for 45 mins–1 hr until the chicken is cooked through and tender. Scatter over the chopped coriander and serve with couscous. Once completely cool, will keep chilled for up to three days or frozen for three months. Defrost in the fridge overnight before reheating over a low heat or in the microwave until piping hot.",

Transfer the chicken pieces to a large baking tray (discard any remaining marinade), and cook for 10-15 mins. Turn the pieces after 10 mins so they colour evenly on both sides. The chicken doesn’t need to be completely cooked through at this point as it will cook for a few more mins in the sauce.

Simmer, covered, until the tomatoes have completely disintegrated, about 20-25 mins. Remove the whole spices and blend the tomato mixture with a stick blender, then pass it through a sieve to make a smooth purée. Return to a clean pan, add the chilli powder and simmer for 12-15 mins. It should slowly begin to thicken. When the sauce turns glossy, add the chicken pieces and any of the reserved roasting juices from the tray. Slowly stir in the butter, a couple of pieces at a time, and simmer for 6-8 mins until the chicken is cooked through. Add the chopped ginger, green chillies and cream, then simmer for a min or two longer, taking care that the sauce doesn’t split. Stir in 1 tsp salt, fenugreek leaves, if using, and the garam masala, then check the seasoning, adjust if necessary, then add the sugar.

      "1 tbsp goose fat",
      "600g shin beef, cut into large chunks",
      "100g smoked streaky bacon, sliced",
      "350g shallot  or pearl onions, peeled",
      "250g chestnut mushrooms (about 20)",
      "2 garlic cloves, sliced",
      "1 bouquet garni (see know-how below)",
      "1 tbsp tomato purée",
      "750ml bottle red wine, Burgundy is good",
      "600g (about 1)  celeriac",
      "2 tbsp olive oil, plus a glug",
      "1 or 2  rosemary and thyme sprigs",
      "2 bay leaves"
    ],
    "steps": "Heat a large casserole pan and add 1 tbsp goose fat. Season 600g large chunks of shin beef and fry until golden brown, about 3-5 mins, then turn over and fry the other side until the meat is browned all over, adding more fat if necessary. Do this in 2-3 batches, transferring the meat to a colander set over a bowl when browned. In the same pan, fry 100g sliced smoked streaky bacon, 350g peeled shallots or pearl onions, 250g chestnut mushrooms, 2 sliced garlic cloves and 1 bouquet garni until lightly browned. Mix in 1 tbsp tomato purée and cook for a few mins, stirring the mixture. This enriches the bourguignon and makes a great base for the stew. Then return the beef and any drained juices to the pan and stir through. Pour over 750ml bottle red wine and about 100ml water so the meat bobs up from the liquid, but isn’t completely covered. Bring to the boil and use a spoon to scrape the caramelised cooking juices from the bottom of the pan – this will give the stew more flavour. Heat oven to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2. Make a cartouche: tear off a square of foil slightly larger than the casserole, arrange it in the pan so it covers the top of the stew and trim away any excess foil. Cook for 3 hrs. If the sauce looks watery, remove the beef and veg with a slotted spoon, and set aside. Cook the sauce over a high heat for a few mins until the sauce has thickened a little, then return the beef and vegetables to the pan. To make the celeriac mash, peel 600g celeriac and cut into cubes. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large frying pan. Tip in the celeriac and fry for 5 mins until it turns golden. Season well with salt and pepper. Stir in 1 or 2 sprigs of rosemary and thyme, 2 bay leaves and 4 cardamom pods, then pour over 200ml water, enough to nearly cover the celeriac. Turn the heat to low, partially cover the pan and leave to simmer for 25-30 mins. After 25-30 mins, the celeriac should be soft and most of the water will have evaporated. Drain away any remaining water, then remove the herb sprigs, bay and cardamom pods. Lightly crush with a potato masher, then finish with a glug of olive oil and season to taste. Spoon the beef bourguignon into serving bowls and place a large spoonful of the celeriac mash on top. Garnish with one of the bay leaves, if you like.",

    ],
    "steps": "If you’re using the porcini mushrooms, cover 10g of mushrooms in boiling water for 20 mins, then squeeze out but keep the soaking water. Heat the oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Heat 1 tbsp vegetable oil in a large casserole dish, brown 1kg large chunks of braising steak really well in batches, then set aside. Add 2 large onions, roughly chopped, and 4 large carrots, chopped into large chunks, to the pan. Add a drizzle more vegetable oil, then cook on a low heat for 5 mins until coloured. Add the soaked porcini mushrooms, sizzle for 1 min more, then scatter over 2 tsp golden caster sugar and 4 tbsp plain flour, stirring until the flour turns brown. Tip the braising steak and any juices back into the pan and give it all a good stir. Pour over 300ml dark ale, 2 beef stock cubes mixed with 400ml boiling water and the porcini mushroom soaking liquid, discarding the last few drops. Season the stew, tuck in a small tied-together bunch of thyme, bay leaf and parsley, and bring everything to a simmer. Cover with a lid and place in the oven for about 2 hrs, until the braising steak is really tender. While the stew is cooking, heat a drop more vegetable oil in a frying pan and sizzle 200g smoked bacon lardons for 3 mins until crisp. Turn up the heat, add 200g halved chestnut mushrooms and cook for 4 mins until golden. Remove from the heat and, when the stew is cooked, stir them through. Leave everything to cool completely – better still, make this up to 2 days in advance and keep it in the fridge as the pie will be better if the filling is fridge-cold when added. Can also be frozen for up to 3 months and defrosted when needed. Make the pastry up to 2 days before you want to assemble the pie. Crumble 650g plain flour and 250g cold diced lard or butter, together with a generous pinch of sea salt until completely combined, then add up to 200ml ice-cold water to make a soft dough. This can be done in a food processor if you want. Knead the pastry, then wrap in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for at least 1 hr. The pastry can be made up to 2 days ahead and kept in the fridge or frozen for up to a month. When you want to make the pie, heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and place a flat baking tray in the oven. Heavily grease a 24-28cm pie dish and dust well with flour. Cut a third off the pastry and set aside. Roll out the pastry to a thickish round that will easily line the pie dish with an overhang, then line the tin. Add the braising steak to the dish using a slotted spoon so some gravy is left in the container, as you don’t want too much sauce in the pie. You want the filling to be slightly higher than the rim of the dish. If you have a bit too much, set it aside. Roll out the remaining pastry to a thick round big enough to cover the dish. Brush the edges of the pastry in the dish with 1 beaten egg yolk, then cover with the pastry lid. Trim the edges, crimp the pastry, then re-roll your trimmings to make a decoration, for example, pastry leaves. Brush the top heavily with egg. Make a few little slits in the centre of the pie, place on the hot baking tray. Bake for 40 mins until golden. Leave the pie to rest for 10 mins while you heat up the gravy left in the container. Serve the pie at the table with a jug of gravy and a big pile of greens.",

Once coloured, add all the remaining ingredients for the beef, except the cornfl our and bacon, and bring to a simmer. Partly cover the pan with a lid and continue to cook for a further 2-2½ hrs or until the beef is tender. Once cooked, tip everything into a colander set over another pan so you can catch the sauce. Tip the contents of the colander into a large pie dish, about 28cm x 23cm x 5cm. Re-boil the sauce and check for seasoning. Thicken with the loosened cornfl our, adding a little at a time and stirring until you have the desired coating consistency. Spoon enough sauce over the beef to barely cover and loosen it, then stir. Remaining sauce can be frozen, ready to re-heat and offer separately on the day. While the beef is cooling, make the mash. Boil the potatoes until tender, 15-20 mins, depending on size. Drain off the water and replace the lid. Shake the pan to break up the boiled potatoes. Add butter and milk a little at a time while mashing. Season. Spoon and spread the mashed potatoes on top of the cooled beef. Once covered, the mash can be marked with a spoon, palette knife or fork for a more interesting fi nish (see Gary’s tip, left). When cold, the cottage pie is ready to cover and freeze. The day before serving, transfer the pie to the fridge to defrost overnight. (Or reheat from frozen on the day, see below.) On the day, reheat the pie. Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. If thawed, bake for 50 mins-1 hr, or until heated through, then increase heat to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6 for the fi nal 10 mins for a golden brown topping.

Return meat to the pan, add flour and stir for 1 min. Add treacle, cumin, tomatoes and stock. Bring to boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 1 hr 45 mins. Stir occasionally and check that the meat is covered with liquid. Add peppers and beans, and cook for a further 15 mins. The stew can now be cooled and kept in the fridge for 2 days, or frozen for 1 month. Serve in bowls, with sour cream, coriander and cornbread.",

Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Place a colander over another large bowl and strain the marinated meat, keeping the wine. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large frying pan, then brown the meat in batches, transferring to a plate once browned. When all the meat is browned, pour a little wine into the now-empty frying pan and bubble to release any caramelised bits from the pan. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large casserole and fry 3 large or 6 normal carrots, cut into large chunks, and 2 roughly chopped onions until they start to colour. Stir in 3 tbsp plain flour for 1 min, then add 1 tbsp tomato purée. Add the beef and any juices, the wine from the frying pan and the rest of the wine and herbs. Season and bring to a simmer. Give everything a good stir, then cover. Transfer to the oven and bake for 2 hrs until the meat is really tender. Cool. Will freeze for up to 3 months. To serve, defrost completely overnight in the fridge if frozen, then place on a low heat to warm through. Meanwhile, heat a small knob of butter in a frying pan and add 300g bacon lardons and 500g peeled pearl onions or small shallots. Sizzle for about 10 mins until the bacon starts to crisp and the onions soften and colour. Add 400g halved mushrooms and fry for another 5 mins, then stir everything into the stew and heat for 10 mins more. Serve scattered with chopped parsley.",

    "steps": "Marinate the beef overnight in the ale with the garlic and bay leaves. The next day, drain the beef from the marinade, reserving the marinade. Pat the meat dry with kitchen paper and toss it in the seasoned flour until evenly coated. Shake off any excess flour. Heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil in a large flameproof casserole until hot. Fry the beef in 3-4 batches for about 5 minutes per batch, stirring occasionally, until it is a rich golden brown all over. You may need to add a little more oil between batches but make sure it is hot again before adding the next batch. Remove the meat with a slotted spoon to a plate and set aside. Don’t worry if the bottom of the casserole is starting to brown, this all adds to the flavour of the finished dish. Lower the heat to medium and fry the pancetta in the casserole for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until crisp and golden. Scoop the pancetta out with a slotted spoon and set aside with the beef. Preheat the oven to fan 140C/conventional 160C/gas 3. Tip the carrots, onions and leek into the casserole and fry, stirring occasionally, until they start to brown – this takes about 12 minutes. Spoon in the tomato purée and continue to cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the beef and pour in the reserved marinade. Bring to a simmer, scraping any sticky bits off the bottom of the pan, then add all the beef stock and bouquet garni to the casserole. Season with salt and pepper and bring everything to the boil. Remove from the heat. Cover with a lid and cook in the oven for 2 hours, stirring once halfway through. (The carbonnade may now be left to cool and frozen for up to 1 month. Add 100ml/31⁄2 fl oz more stock to the sauce when reheating.) When the beef is ready, taste for seasoning and add more salt and pepper if you think it needs it. Scatter the chopped parsley over the top and serve straight from the casserole, with creamy mash or jacket potatoes and buttered greens or cabbage.",

This can be done up to 3 days in advance and chilled until ready to make the pie or frozen for up to 3 months. To make the pie heat oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6. Tip the filling into a 2-litre pie or baking dish. Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured surface to fit the pie dish with a slight overhang and drape over the dish. Crimp the edges if you are able to and poke a couple of little steam holes in the middle. Brush the pastry with the beaten egg and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Bake for 30 mins until golden brown.

Measure 150ml of cold water and 150ml boiling water into a jug and mix them together – this will mean your water is a good temperature for the yeast. Add the oil and 1 tsp salt to the warm water then pour it over the flour. Stir well with a spoon then start to knead the mixture together in the bowl until it forms a soft and slightly sticky dough. If it’s too dry add a splash of cold water. Dust a little flour on the work surface and knead the dough for 10 mins. Put it back in the mixing bowl and cover with cling film greased with a few drops of olive oil. Leave to rise in a warm place for 1 hr or until doubled in size. Heat oven to 220C/200C/gas 9 and put a baking sheet or pizza stone on the top shelf to heat up. Once the dough has risen, knock it back by punching it a couple of times with your fist then kneading it again on a floured surface. It should be springy and a lot less sticky. Set aside while you prepare the sauce. Put all the ingredients for the tomato sauce together in a bowl, season with salt, pepper and a pinch of sugar if you like and mix well. Set aside until needed. Divide the dough into 2 or 4 pieces (depending on whether you want to make large or small pizzas), shape into balls and flatten each piece out as thin as you can get it with a rolling pin or using your hands. Make sure the dough is well dusted with flour to stop it sticking. Dust another baking sheet with flour then put a pizza base on top – spread 4-5 tbsp of the tomato sauce on top and add some sliced tomatoes and grated vegan cheese. Drizzle with a little olive oil and bake in the oven on top of your preheated baking tray for 10-12 mins or until the base is puffed up and the vegan cheese has melted and is bubbling and golden in patches. Repeat with the rest of the dough and topping. Serve the pizzas with fresh basil leaves or chilli oil if you like and sprinkle over vegan parmesan just after baking.",

Add the yeast or beef extract, sugar and vinegar, then the beef and herbs. Top up with stock until the brisket is just over half submerged. Cover and cook for 7-8 hrs on low until tender. Remove the meat from the slow cooker and cover to keep warm. Use the reduce or simmer function on your slow cooker and simmer for 10-15 mins until the gravy has thickened to your liking. If yourslow cooker doesn’t have a simmer function, pour the gravy into a pan and simmer on the hob until thickened. Add a pinch more salt, sugar or a dash more vinegar if needed. If you like your gravy to be extra-thick, mix the cornflour with a splash of cold water, then add to the pan and bubble for a few minutes. Just before you remove the meat from the slow cooker, start on the mash. Cook the potatoes in a pan of boiling salted water for 20 mins until very tender when pressed. Drain and steam-dry for a few minutes before mashing with the horseradish, butter and crème fraîche. Scatter with parsley to serve. Cut the brisket into wedges and serve with the gravy and mash.",

Add 2 finely chopped garlic cloves, 3 tbsp plain flour and 1 tbsp tomato purée, increase the heat and cook for a few mins, then return the beef to the pan.

Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 45 mins. By this time the gravy should be thick and coating the meat. Check after about 30 mins – if a lot of liquid remains, increase the heat slightly to reduce the gravy a little. Season well, then discard the bay leaves and thyme stalks. Meanwhile, make the mash. In a large saucepan, cover the 1.8kg potatoes which you've peeled and chopped, in salted cold water, bring to the boil and simmer until tender. Drain well, then allow to steam-dry for a few mins. Mash well with the 225ml milk, 25g butter, and three-quarters of the 200g strong cheddar cheese, then season with freshly grated nutmeg and some salt and pepper. Spoon the meat into 2 ovenproof dishes. Pipe or spoon on the mash to cover. Sprinkle on the remaining cheese. If eating straight away, heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and cook for 25-30 mins, or until the topping is golden. If you want to use a slow cooker, brown your mince in batches then tip into your slow cooker and stir in the vegetables, flour, purée, wine, stock, Worcestershire sauce and herbs with some seasoning. Cover and cook on High for 4-5 hours. Make the mash following the previous steps, and then oven cook in the same way to finish.",

      "80ml olive oil, plus extra for brushing",

      "150g coconut oil, plus extra for the tin",
      "500g spelt flour"
    ],
    "steps": "First, make the filling. Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Mix together 1½ tbsp oil with the cumin, cinnamon and vinegar, and rub the mixture all over the beetroot. Put the beetroot into a small roasting tin, season well, then cover with foil and roast for 20 mins. Meanwhile, toss the celeriac with 2½ tbsp oil, the thyme, garlic and some seasoning in a second roasting tin. Separate out the slices so they cook evenly, then cover the tin in foil. In a third roasting tin, mix the sweet potato with the remaining oil, the smoked paprika and some seasoning, and cover with foil. Once the beets have cooked for 20 mins, add the celeriac and sweet potato to the oven alongside them, and roast all the veg for 40 mins further or until tender. Remove the thyme sprigs, squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skins and mash them in with the celeriac, then leave all the veg to cool. All the veg can be cooked the day before and kept in the fridge. For the pastry, boil the kettle and use some coconut oil to grease a deep 20cm springform cake tin. Pour the flour into a bowl and add 1 tsp salt. Mix the coconut oil with 200ml boiling water, stir until melted (put it in the microwave if need be), then pour into the flour and mix with a wooden spoon to form a dough. Working as quickly as you can (it’s best to roll the pastry when it’s warm), cut off a ¼ of the dough and set aside under a tea towel. Roll out the rest to 0.5cm thick, then use it to line the cake tin, pressing the dough into the corners and leaving any excess pastry overhanging the sides. Don’t worry if the pastry breaks – it’s very forgiving, so you can patch it up as you go. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Now build the pie. Cover the base with chard leaves, then scatter over the semolina (which will absorb the beet juices), press in the beetroot, and season. Add another layer of chard, followed by the sweet potato, and season. Add a final layer of chard leaves, then top with the celeriac and season again. Roll out the pastry you set aside to a thickness of 0.5cm to use as the lid. Put the lid on top of the pie and, using a fork, press together the overhanging pastry to create a crimped edge. Make a steam hole, then brush the top with a little almond milk mixed with a spoonful of oil (this will help to colour the pastry). Bake in the centre of the oven for 45 mins until the pastry is a deep golden brown. Leave to cool for 15 mins, then remove from the tin and serve in the middle of the table. Will keep for up to three days in the fridge (the pie is also delicious cold).",

Turn the mushrooms and chips over after 10 mins. Meanwhile, squeeze as much juice as you can out of the jackfruit. The best way is to wrap it in kitchen paper, then squeeze with your hands. Trim off the feathery bits of jackfruit that look a bit like shredded meat, weigh out 75g and stir in the tamari sauce. Tip the remaining jackfruit into a bowl. Add the chickpeas, tomato purée and garlic and blitz together until smooth using a hand blender or use a food processor. Stir in the remaining jackfruit and shape into four burgers about the size of the mushrooms. Coat in the flour. Check the chips and mushrooms and cook for 5-10 mins longer if needed. Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil and fry two of the burgers for a few minutes each side until brown and heated through. To make the relish, put the chopped tomatoes in a bowl with the tomato purée, vinegar, onion and basil or coriander. To serve, sandwich two of the burgers between the mushrooms. If the mushrooms are very juicy, blot with a little kitchen paper first. Serve with half the chips, sprinkled with the paprika, and serve half the relish on the side. The remaining mushrooms, burgers and chips will keep for two days in the fridge. To serve again, warm the remaining mushrooms and burgers in a low oven, and heat the chips, uncovered, until piping hot.",

    "steps": "Put the unpeeled potatoes in a large saucepan, cover with water, bring to the boil and simmer for 40 mins until the skins start to split. Drain and leave to cool a little. Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a large heavy-based sauté pan or flameproof casserole dish. Add the mushrooms, leeks , onions, carrots and the stock cube and cook gently for 5 mins , stirring every so often. If it starts to stick, reduce the heat and stir more frequently, scraping the bits from the bottom. The veg should be soft but not mushy. Add the garlic, tomato purée, paprika, squash and herbs. Stir and turn the heat up a bit, cook for 3 mins, add the celery, then stir and cook for a few more mins. Tip in the chickpeas along with the water in the can and reserved mushroom stock. Add the peas and spinach and stir well. Cook for 5 mins, stirring occasionally, then season, turn off and set aside. There should still be plenty of liquid and the veg should be bright and a little firm. Peel the potatoes and discard the skin. Mash 200g with a fork and stir into the veg. Break the rest of the potatoes into chunks, mix with the olive oil and parsley and season. Divide the filling into the pie dishes and top with the potatotes. Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and bake the pies for 40-45 mins, until the top is golden and the filling is heated through. If making individual pies, check after 20 mins. Best served with tomato ketchup – as all great shepherd’s pies are.",

Put the dairy-free milk into a jug and add the vinegar, leave for a few minutes until it looks a little lumpy. Put half of the vanilla seeds and all the other cake ingredients into a large bowl, then pour over the milk mixture. Using electric beaters or a wooden spoon, beat everything together until smooth. Divide the mix between your two tins, then bake in the centre of the oven for 30-35 mins or until a skewer inserted into the middle of the cakes comes out clean. Leave them in their tins until cool enough to handle, then carefully turn out onto wire racks to cool completely. While the cakes are cooling, make the filling. To make the vegan buttercream, whisk or beat together the dairy-free spread, icing sugar and remaining vanilla seeds until pale and fluffy. Dairy-free spreads do vary, so if the spread you are using is quite soft, try to avoid using electric beaters. Stir the ingredients together instead to avoid overworking it. However, if the mixture is too firm, use electric beaters to help lighten it and add 1-2 tbsp dairy-free milk when whisking. Spread the jam onto one of the cooled sponges, top with the buttercream, then place the other sponge on top. Dust the assembled cake with a little icing sugar or caster sugar before slicing.",

Use 2 tbsp of batter to make each pancake, frying two at a time – any more will make it difficult to flip them. Push 4-5 pieces of banana into each pancake and cook until bubbles start to pop on the surface, and the edges look dry. They will be a little more delicate than egg-based pancakes, so turn them over carefully and cook the other sides for 1 min. Repeat to make 8-10 pancakes. Meanwhile, put the remaining coconut milk and sugar in a small pan. Add a pinch of salt and simmer until the mixture thickens to the consistency of single cream.

    "steps": "Day 1:To begin your starter, mix 50g flour with 50g tepid water in a jar or, better still, a plastic container. Make sure all the flour is incorporated and leave, semi-uncovered, at room temperature for 24 hrs. Day 2:Mix 50g flour with 50g tepid water and stir into yesterday’s mixture. Make sure all the flour is incorporated and leave, semi-uncovered, at room temperature for another 24 hrs. Day 3:Mix 50g flour with 50g tepid water and stir into yesterday’s mixture. Make sure all the flour is incorporated and leave, semi-uncovered, at room temperature for another 24 hrs. Day 4:You should start to see some activity in the mixture now; there should be some bubbles forming and bubbling on top. Mix 50g flour with 50g tepid water and stir into yesterday’s mixture. Make sure all the flour is incorporated and leave, semi-uncovered, at room temperature for another 24 hrs. Day 5:The mixture should be very active now and ready for making your levain. If it’s not bubbling, continue to feed it on a daily basis until it does. When it’s ready, it should smell like yogurt. You now have a starter, which is the base to the bread. You’ll need to look after it, but naming is optional! Keep it in the fridge (it will stay dormant) and 24 hrs before you want to use it, pour half of it off and feed it with 100g flour and 100g water. Leave it at room temperature and it should become active again. The longer the starter has been dormant, the more times it will need to be refreshed – the process of pouring off half the starter and replacing it with new flour and water – to reactivate. If your starter is ready to use, a teaspoonful of the mixture should float in warm water. For the levainMix 1 tbsp of the starter with 100g flour and 100g water (this is the same process as feeding the starter, but you should do this in a new, separate bowl, keeping the original starter as back-up, as this is the mixture you'll use to bake your bread). Leave the levain for 8 hrs at room temperature until it becomes active. When ready, a teaspoonful of the mixture should float in warm water. For the breadPour 600g tepid water into the levain and stir with a rubber spatula to mix together – don’t worry if there are unmixed bits of levain. Tip in the flour and mix everything together with a rubber spatula to make a rough dough, ensuring all the flour is incorporated evenly and that there are no dry bits up the side of the bowl. Cover and leave somewhere warm for at least 30 mins, or up to 4 hrs. Sprinkle over the salt and add 50g water to the dough. Pinch and scrunch the salt and water through the dough with your hands. If the dough goes stringy (like old chewing gum), just keep working it until it’s one smooth texture. Leave for another 15 mins. Wet your hands, grab the dough from one side and stretch it over itself, then repeat with the other side. This stretching technique helps develop the gluten. Pick the dough up and curl it around onto itself, then cover and leave for another 20-30 mins. Repeat this process two more times (three in total), then leave the dough for another 2-3 hrs until it’s risen by about 30% and looks bubbly and soft. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and split in two. Fold each piece onto itself to create a ball, then leave uncovered for 30 mins. The dough balls will spread during this time. Dust two bread-proving baskets generously with flour. Scrape one of the balls of dough off the work surface, then fold it onto itself to create a tight ball that’s trapped in all the air. Lift the ball into a basket, seam-side up, then transfer to the fridge to chill overnight, or for up to 18 hrs. Repeat with the other dough ball. Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 9 and put a lidded casserole dish in the oven to heat. Cut a sheet of baking parchment into a square slightly larger than the base of one of the loaves. Carefully remove the hot casserole dish from the oven and remove the lid. Invert one loaf onto the baking parchment, then, working quickly, score the top at an angle. Use the corners of the parchment to lift the loaf into the casserole dish. Cover with the lid and bake for 30 mins, then carefully uncover and continue to bake for another 10 mins (or longer for a darker finish). Carefully lift the bread out of the dish using a spatula, transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool to room temperature before slicing. Repeat with the second loaf.",

Add the onion, carrot, celery and a pinch of salt. Cook gently, stirring for 10 mins until soft. Remove the porcini from the liquid, keeping the mushroomy stock and roughly chop. Set both aside. Add the garlic and thyme to the pan. Cook for 1 min, then stir in the tomato purée and cook for a minute more. Pour in the red wine, if using, cook until nearly reduced, then add the lentils, reserved mushroom stock and cans of tomatoes. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and leave to simmer with the lid on. Meanwhile, heat a large frying pan. Add 1½ tbsp oil, then tip all of the mushrooms into the pan, including the rehydrated ones. Fry until all the water has evaporated and the mushrooms are deep golden brown. Pour in the soy sauce. Give everything a good mix, then scrape the mushrooms into the lentil saucepan. Stir in the Marmite, then continue to cook the ragu, stirring occasionally, over a low to medium heat for 30-45 mins until the lentils are cooked and the sauce is thick and reduced, adding extra water if necessary. Remove the thyme sprigs and season to taste. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. To make the white sauce, heat 3 tbsp olive oil in a pan, whisk in the flour and cook for a couple of minutes to get rid of the raw flour taste, then slowly whisk in the soya milk. Cook until you have a creamy sauce, about 10 mins. Season to taste, adding a good grating of nutmeg. Spread a third of the ragu on the bottom of your ovenproof dish, then top with six lasagne sheets, followed by another third of the vegan white sauce, then another third of the ragu. Top with the remaining lasagne sheets, then the remaining ragu and finally, spread over the rest of the white sauce. Sprinkle over the nutritional yeast, if using, and bake for 45 mins-1 hr until the pasta is cooked.",

    "steps": "Mix the flour, yeast and salt in a large mixing bowl. Make a dip in the centre of the flour and pour in almost 300ml hand warm (cool rather than hot) water and 1 tbsp olive oil, with a round-bladed knife. Then mix in enough of the remaining water and a bit more if needed, to gather up any dry bits in the bottom of the bowl, until the mixture comes together as a soft, not too sticky, dough. Gather it into a ball with your hands. Put the dough onto a very lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 mins until it feels smooth and elastic, only adding the minimum of extra flour if necessary to prevent the dough sticking. Place the ball of dough on a lightly floured work surface. Cover with an upturned, clean, large glass bowl and leave for 45 mins-1 hr or until doubled in size and feels light and springy. Timing will depend on the warmth of the room. Knock back the dough by gently kneading just 3-4 times. You only want to knock out any large air bubbles, so too much handling now will lose the dough’s lightness. Shape into a ball, then cover and leave for 10 mins. Cut the dough into 10 even pieces. Shape each into a ball and sit them on 2 baking parchment-lined baking sheets. Cover with a clean dry tea towel and leave for 40-45 mins, or until about doubled in size. Finish by using your fingers press a wide indent in the middle of each roll. Scatter over the roasted peppers, cheese and olives pressing down quite firmly into the indents, finish with rocket. Drizzle with most of the remaining oil mixed with a good pinch of dried oregano. Season. Put a roasting tin in the bottom of the oven 20 mins before ready to bake and heat oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. Put the risen bread in the oven, carefully pour about 250ml cold water into the roasting tin (this will hiss and create a burst of steam to give you a crisp crust), then lower the heat to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Bake for 20 mins or until golden. Remove and cool on a wire rack. If you tap the underneath of the loaf if should be firm and sound hollow. When baked, drizzle with a little extra olive oil.",

      "250g chestnut mushrooms, roughly chopped",
      "150g portobello mushrooms, roughly chopped",
      "½ tbsp vegetable oil",
      "2 shallots, peeled, trimmed and quartered lengthways",
      "1 carrot, roughly chopped",
      "3 thyme sprigs, leaves picked",
      "1 garlic clove, crushed",
      "½ tbsp tomato purée",
      "1½ tbsp plain flour, plus extra for dusting",
      "125ml red wine (check it's vegan)",

      "500g vegan puff pastry block"
    ],
    "steps": "Cook the mushrooms in a large saucepan, covered, for 5 mins. Remove the lid so the liquid can evaporate, about 15 mins. Add the oil and fry the mushrooms for 5-6 mins until golden. Remove to a bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving any excess oil behind, and set aside. Fry the shallots for 6-8 mins until beginning to brown, then add the carrot, thyme leaves and garlic, and fry for 1 min. Add the tomato purée and flour, mix well and cook for 1-2 mins. Pour in the wine, stir and simmer for 3-4 mins until the alcohol has evaporated. Pour in the stock and cook for 15-20 mins more until the shallots and carrots are almost tender. Return the mushrooms to the pan and cook for 10-15 mins more until everything is cooked through, the liquid has almost evaporated and the sauce is thick. It’s important that you cook the liquid down until thick, or it will be difficult to shape later. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for 1 hr until cold. You can make the filling up to three days ahead and chill. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Cut off a third of the pastry block and roll out on a lightly floured surface to a 5mm-thick square. Put on a sheet of baking parchment. Spoon the cooled veg mixture into the centre piling it up high. Roll out the larger pastry block as before, ensuring the square is enough to cover the base. Brush the exposed pastry on the base around the mushroom filling with soya milk, then lay the larger pastry square on top to enclose the filling. Press around the edges to seal, then trim the edges so you end up with an 18cm circle with the filling in the middle. Score lines or patterns into the top of the pastry, being careful not to cut all the way through. Brush all over with soya milk, then bake for 30-40 mins until the filling is hot and the pastry is puffed up and golden.",

Meanwhile, heat 1 tbsp oil in a large frying pan and fry the shallots for 10 mins until tender. Add the mushrooms and fry for 15 mins until softened, and the liquid has evaporated. Add the garlic and remaining sage to the mushrooms, fry for a minute, then add the double cream. Stir until it coats the mushrooms and no liquid remains. Fold in the breadcrumbs, mace, chestnuts and roast squash. Season everything well, adding a grating of nutmeg. Leave to cool before assembling the wellington. Roll the pastry out on a floured work surface to a 35 x 45cm rectangle. Transfer to a large parchment-lined baking sheet with one of the long lengths of the pastry facing towards you. Spoon the mushroom and squash mixture down the length of the pastry, leaving a 7cm border along the top and 1cm on both sides. Brush all the exposed pastry with beaten egg. Put the beetroots in a line down the middle of the filling – they should be touching. Fold the filling-covered, long length of the pastry over the beets, using the paper to help you. Roll up and trim the pastry with a knife when it’s overlapping by 1cm. Place the wellington seal-side down, and pinch the ends to seal. Egg wash the whole thing and use a fork or blunt cutlery knife to score the pastry in a pretty pattern. Chill until for at least 30 mins, or up to 24 hrs. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Brush the wellington with more beaten egg, sprinkle with the sesame or poppy seeds and bake for 45-50 mins until golden brown and puffed up. Leave to rest for 10 mins before carving into chunky slices with a sharp knife to serve.",

Cut the tofu into thick slices. Heat a griddle pan over high heat and lightly brush the tofu and spring onions with the oil.

Combine the flour, yeast, sugar and 1 tsp salt in a large bowl or stand mixer. Add the cooled butter mixture, and mix to a soft dough using a wooden spoon or the mixer. Knead for 10 mins by hand (or 5 mins using a mixer) until the dough feels bouncy and smooth. Transfer to an oiled bowl and cover with a clean tea towel. Leave somewhere warm to rise for 1½-2 hrs, or until doubled in size. Alternatively, leave to prove in the fridge overnight. Oil and line a baking sheet with baking parchment. Knock the air out of the dough, then knead again for several minutes. Flatten a small piece of dough (about 20g) into a disc, and put a cube of the mozzarella and a pinch of the gruyère into the middle of the disc. Enclose the cheeses with the dough, then roll into a ball. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining cheese and dough, placing the dough balls ½cm apart on the baking sheet – they should be just touching after proving. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave somewhere warm to rise for 30 mins. Meanwhile, make the garlic butter. Melt the butter in a small pan over a low heat, then stir in the garlic and rosemary. Remove from the heat and set aside until needed. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Brush the risen dough balls with the garlic butter, then bake for 25-30 mins until the dough balls are cooked through and the middles are oozing. While the dough balls are baking, make the tomato sauce dip. Heat the oil in a saucepan and fry the garlic for 30 seconds. Tip in the passata, vinegar, sugar and chilli flakes, and simmer for 10 mins until thickened. Season to taste and stir in the basil.

Remove the bowl of the slow cooker carefully and set on a heatproof mat or chopping board. Mix with a wooden spoon or spatula vigorously for 10-15 mins to cool the fudge and to break up any large sugar crystals. The fudge will thicken as it cools and start to look matte.

On a lightly floured surface, knead dough for 10 mins until smooth. Put the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with oiled cling film, then leave to rise in a warm place until doubled in size. The dough is now ready to be shaped. To make 12 rolls, divide the dough into 12 pieces and shape into rolls. Lightly flour 3 baking sheets. Place the rolls onto the sheets and cover loosely with oiled cling film. Set aside in a warm place for 30 mins or until they have doubled in size. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Brush the bread with beaten egg and sprinkle with sesame and poppy seeds. Bake for 15-20 mins until deep golden brown and well risen.

Dry thoroughly, then brush the inside of the pots with oil and line with parchment paper. Shape dough into a smooth round with a roughly pointed shape at one end so it half-fills the pot. Leave until doubled in size. Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Brush the top of the loaf with beaten egg, sprinkle with poppy or sesame seeds and bake for 45-50 mins (15-20 mins for small loaves) until golden. Let it sit for 5-10 mins, then take out of the pot and leave to cool on a wire rack.",

    ],
    "steps": "Combine the flour, yeast, sugar and 1½ tsp fine salt in a large mixing bowl, or the bowl of a tabletop mixer. Measure out 300ml warm water and add roughly 280ml to the flour, along with the olive oil, and start mixing until the ingredients start to clump together as a dough. If the dough seems a little dry, add the remaining water. Once combined, knead for 10 mins by hand on your work surface, or for 5 mins on a medium speed in a mixer. The dough is ready when it feels soft, springy and elastic. Clean the bowl, drizzle in a little oil, then pop the dough back in, turning it over and coating the sides of the bowl in oil. Cover with some oiled cling film and set aside in a warm place to double in size – this will take 1-3 hrs, depending on the temperature. Line a baking tray with parchment. Uncover the dough and punch it down a couple of times with your fist, knocking out all the air bubbles. Tip out onto a floured work surface and dust the top with a little flour too, if it is sticky. Roll the dough out to a rectangle, roughly 40 x 30cm. Spread the pesto over the dough, then scatter over the tomatoes, both cheeses and the basil. Roll the dough up from one of the longer sides, into a long sausage. Use a sharp knife to cut the dough into 12 even pieces. Place on the baking tray, cut-side up, in a 3-by-4 formation, making sure the open end of each roll is tucked in towards the centre on the arrangement – this will prevent them from uncoiling during cooking. Leave a little space between each roll as they will grow and touch as they prove. Loosely cover with oiled cling film and leave to prove for 30 mins–1 hr until almost doubled in size again. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Uncover the bread when it is puffed up. Bake on the middle shelf in the oven for 35-40 mins until golden brown and the centre looks dry and not doughy. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for at least 10 mins.",

    "steps": "Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Put the flour and butter in a bowl and rub them together with your fingers. Rubbing in mixture with cold butter is hard and tiring on young fingers, so use slightly softened butter – but not so soft that it is oily. Now stir in the paprika and mix again. Add 100ml milk and mix with a fork until you get a soft dough. Add a splash more milk if the dough is dry. This process will teach you how to feel the dough and decide if it needs more liquid. You can always add more milk if required. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough like pastry to about 0.5cm thick. Try to keep a rectangular shape. Only roll in one direction, and roll and turn, roll and turn – by keeping the dough moving, you avoid finding it stuck at the end. Sprinkle the grated cheese on top, then roll up like a sausage along the long side. Cut into 12 thick rings using a table knife. Get an adult to show you how to hold the dough with one hand and cut straight through with the other. Line the baking tray with baking parchment. Place the roll-ups on the parchment, cut-side down, almost touching each other, making sure that you can see the spiral. Get an adult to put them in the oven for you and bake for 20-25 mins until golden and melty. Ask an adult to remove them from the oven, then leave to cool. The cheese roll-ups will keep for up to 3 days in an airtight container.",

Push the garlic butter generously between each cut, allowing some to ooze onto the top – it will caramelise and taste superb. Sprinkle the paprika over. Wrap the bread up like a cracker in a double thickness of foil. You can prepare to this stage up to a day ahead. Put the pack straight onto the barbecue. Cook for 2 minutes then roll it over onto its side and cook for 2 minutes more. Roll it onto its other side and cook for a further 2 minutes.

Mix together, then add the melted butter and 275ml warm water. Mix to a dough, then knead for 10 mins by hand (or 5 mins in a freestanding mixer) until the dough feels stretchy and soft. Clean out the bowl, then lightly grease with a little oil. Turn the dough over in the oiled bowl until it’s well coated. Cover with cling film or a tea towel and set aside somewhere warm until the dough has doubled in size. Alternatively, put the dough in the fridge and leave to rise slowly for 2 days (bring it to room temperature before continuing to step 2). Line your largest baking sheet with parchment, and dust with polenta or cornmeal. Drain the mozzarella and dry the balls on some kitchen paper. Tip the dough onto your work surface and punch out the air bubbles. To make a Christmas tree shape, you’ll need 23 balls. Tear off lumps of dough, ensuring each one is roughly the same size (if you want to be exact, weigh the dough, divide the weight by 23, then weigh each ball of dough as you break them off). Shape each piece of dough into a disc and place a ball of mozzarella in the middle. Pull up the sides of the dough to encase the cheese, pinching the dough together to seal. Roll into a ball and place on the baking sheet, sealed-side down, in a tree shape. Leave a little space between each ball, as they will grow when proving. You’re likely to have 2 or 3 balls without mozzarella, so use these pieces of dough for the trunk – for anyone who doesn’t like cheese. Cover the tray with a sheet of oiled cling film and set aside for 30 mins until almost doubled in size. While the dough proves, make the tomato dipping sauce. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the garlic and sizzle for 30 secs until fragrant. Add the tomatoes, oregano, vinegar, sugar and some seasoning. Bubble for 30 mins until the sauce is thick. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. When the dough is ready, uncover the baking sheet and bake for 20-25 mins until golden brown. Meanwhile, make the garlic butter. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the garlic and sizzle for 1-2 mins until the garlic is a shade darker (but not brown). When the bread is cooked, transfer it to a platter. Stir most of the parsley into the garlic butter and use a pastry brush to brush it all over the bread. Leave it to soak in, then brush on more. Sprinkle over a little extra parsley to garnish, if you like. Reheat the tomato sauce and serve it alongside the bread with any remaining garlic butter.",

      "400g malted grain brown bread flour, or wholemeal or granary bread flour",
      "100g strong white bread flour",
      "7g sachet easy-bake dried yeast (or 2 tsp Quick dried yeast)",

    "steps": "Mix your choice of brown flour with the white, the yeast and salt in a large mixing bowl. Put in the butter and rub it into the flour. Mix in the crushed garlic. Make a dip in the centre of the flour and pour in almost 300ml hand warm (cool rather than hot) water, with a round-bladed knife. Then mix in enough of the remaining water and a bit more if needed, to gather up any dry bits in the bottom of the bowl and until the mixture comes together as a soft, not too sticky, dough. Gather it into a ball with your hands. Put the dough on to a very lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 mins until it feels smooth and elastic, only adding the minimum of extra flour if necessary to prevent the dough sticking. Place the ball of dough on a lightly floured work surface. Cover with an upturned, clean, large glass bowl and leave for 45 mins-1 hr or until doubled in size and feels light and springy. Timing will depend on the warmth of the room. Knock back the dough by lightly kneading just 3-4 times. You only want to knock out any large air bubbles, so too much handling now will lose the dough’s lightness. Shape into a ball. Cover with the glass bowl and leave for 15 mins. Shape by cutting the ball into 6 even pieces. Roll each with your hands into a 30-35cm sausage shape, that is plump in the middle and tapers off at each end. For each plait, lay 2 dough sausages in front of you like an X, then lay the other piece lengthways down the middle of the X and scatter over a few slices of proscuitto. Start to plait from the centre down, left over right, right over left etc. When you reach the end, carefully turn the plait over and complete the plaiting, working down from the centre again. Press the tapered ends together to seal then lay each on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment. Tuck the rest of the proscuitto into the folds of each plait. Cover with a clean tea towel. Leave for 40-45 mins, or until doubled in size. Put a roasting tin in the bottom of the oven 20 mins before ready to bake and heat oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. Put the risen bread in the oven, carefully pour about 250ml cold water into the roasting tin (this will hiss and create a burst of steam to give you a crisp crust), then lower the heat to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Bake for 25 mins or until golden. Remove and cool on a wire rack. If you tap the underneath of the loaf if should be firm and sound hollow. Finish by brushing with beaten egg.",

Leave in a warm place until doubled in size – this will take about 1 hr (see note, below). Lightly oil a 900g loaf tin. Once doubled in size, knead the dough again for 3-5 mins to knock out the air bubbles – add most of the seeds and work these into the dough as you knead. Shape the dough into an oval roughly the same length as your tin. Place in the tin and leave to prove, covered with oiled cling film, for 30-45 mins until it has nearly doubled in size again. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Gently press a finger into the loaf to check if it has had enough proving time (see tip). When it’s ready, glaze the top of the loaf with the egg yolk and sprinkle over the remaining seeds. Bake in the oven for 40-45 mins until golden brown – if you tip the loaf out of the tin and tap the bottom, it should sound hollow. Leave to cool on a wire rack for at least 30 mins before slicing.",

    "steps": "First, make the honey & almond sponges. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/ gas 4. Grease two 15cm cake tins and line the bases with baking parchment. Using a stand mixer or electric hand mixer, beat the butter, muscovado sugar and 140g honey until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs and yolks, one at a time, beating after each addition until well incorporated. In a clean bowl, whisk together the flour, almonds, baking powder and 1 / 4 tsp salt. Add half the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat until just combined. Add the vanilla and milk, continuing to beat, then add the remaining flour mixture, beating until just combined. Divide the mixture evenly between the tins and bake for 45-55 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of each cake comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool for 10 mins in their tins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Leave the oven on for the candied almonds. To make a honey syrup, put 2 tbsp honey and 2 tbsp water in a small saucepan and heat for 1-2 mins or until the honey has dissolved. Set aside. Make the candied almonds by heating 150ml water and the sugar in a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan with a sugar thermometer attached, and swirl until the sugar has dissolved. Meanwhile, spread the almonds out on a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 10-12 mins until golden brown. Heat the sugar syrup to 119C, turn off the heat and stir in the warm almonds. Keep stirring until the syrup coats the nuts and turns white and crunchy. Tip the almonds back onto the baking sheet and roughly chop half of them. Next, make the Swiss meringue buttercream. Using a stand mixer or electric hand mixer, beat the butter until pale and fluffy. Put the egg whites and sugar in a clean heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Whisk using a clean electric hand mixer and heat the mixture until the sugar has dissolved (you can check this by feeling some of the egg white between your fingers to check that it isn’t grainy). Remove the bowl from the heat and, using a stand or electric hand mixer, whisk for 10 mins or until the mixture forms stiff peaks and has cooled to room temperature. Add the butter, 1-2 tbsp at a time, and beat until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Beat in the honey and transfer to a piping bag fitted with a 1cm nozzle. To assemble the cake, level the sponges by cutting off the domed tops and split each sponge in half to create four layers. Fix the bottom layer to a cake board or stand with a splodge of buttercream, brush with the honey syrup and pipe a layer of buttercream on top. Gently press the second layer on top and repeat with the remaining layers. Cover the cake with a thin layer of buttercream, then use a palette knife to scrape the sides clean. Pipe a ring of buttercream blobs around the top, or spread a thick layer with a palette knife. Decorate with the candied almonds.",

Then mix in enough of the remaining water and a bit more if needed, to gather up any dry bits in the bottom of the bowl and until the mixture comes together as a soft, not too sticky, dough. Gather it into a ball with your hands. Put the dough on to a very lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 mins until it feels smooth and elastic, only adding the minimum of extra flour if necessary to prevent the dough sticking. Place the ball of dough on a lightly floured work surface. Cover with an upturned, clean, large glass bowl and leave for 45 mins-1 hr or until doubled in size and feels light and springy. Timing will depend on the warmth of the room. Knock back the dough by lightly kneading just 3-4 times. You only want to knock out any large air bubbles, so too much handling now will lose the dough’s lightness. Shape into a ball. Cover with the glass bowl and leave for 15 mins. Now shape to make a tin loaf Grease a 1.2-litre capacity loaf tin (about 23 x 13 x 5.5cm) and line the base with baking parchment. Using your knuckles, flatten the dough into a rectangle about 25 x 19cm. Fold both shorter ends into the centre like an envelope, make a ¼ turn, then flatten again into the same size and roll up very tightly, starting from one of the short ends. Roll the top of the dough in extra seeds and place in the tin with the join underneath, pressing the seeds gently into the dough. Cover with a clean tea towel. Leave for 40-45 mins, or until risen about 5cm above the top of the tin. Put a roasting tin in the bottom of the oven 20 mins before ready to bake and heat oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. Put the risen bread in the oven, carefully pour about 250ml cold water into the roasting tin (this will hiss and create a burst of steam to give you a crisp crust), then lower the heat to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Bake for about 30 mins or until golden, covering with foil for the last 5 mins if starting to brown too quickly. Leave in the tin for 2-3 mins, then remove and cool on a wire rack. If you tap the underneath of the baked loaf if should be firm and sound hollow.",

    ],
    "steps": "Dry fry the cumin seeds for 30-60 seconds in a non-stick pan, tossing constantly until toasted. Remove from heat. Wash the courgettes, then trim and grate them on the coarsest side of the grater (unpeeled) into a largish bowl. Tip in both the flours, the ginger, turmeric and coriander, add 1 tsp salt and stir well. Pour 11⁄2 tbsp of the oil into the flour mixture and rub it in, then gradually add 4-5 tbsp cold water until the mixture comes together to form a soft dough, a bit wetter than pastry. Tear or cut off 12 equal sized pieces and shape into balls. Dust the work surface and rolling pin with a little extra flour and roll each piece into a thin 14cm round – don’t worry if the edges are crinkly. Heat a large cast-iron griddle or heavy-based frying pan until very hot. Put one or two breads on the griddle and cook for 2 minutes on one side, patting the edges with a clean soft cloth – this keeps the bread in contact with the heat and helps cook it fast. Turn the breads over and cook for 2 minutes more. Drizzle a little oil around the edges of the bread, turn them over again and cook for 30-60 seconds more, then drizzle a few drops of oil on this side. Remove and set aside on a plate. Repeat with the rest of the rounds. (You can make the breads up to 2 hours ahead, then wrap in foil and reheat in a low oven.) Serve hot or cold.",

Knead for 5-10 mins until you have a soft, smooth and elastic dough. Try to knead using as little extra flour as possible, just enough so that the dough doesn’t stick – this will keep the pittas light and airy. Once kneaded, place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave to double in size, approximately 1 hour. Heat oven as high as it will go (ideally 250C/230C fan/gas 9) and put a large baking tray on the middle shelf of the oven to get searingly hot. Divide the dough into eight balls then flatten each into a disc with the palm of your hand. On a lightly floured surface, roll each disc into an oval, around 20cm long, 15cm wide and 3-5mm thick. Carefully remove the hot tray from the oven. Dust with flour then place your pittas directly onto it – you may have to do this in batches. Return swiftly to the oven and bake for 4-5 mins, or until the pittas have puffed up and are a pale golden colour. Wrap each hot pitta in a clean tea towel once it's baked to keep it soft while the others cook.",

      "1 tsp  mixed spice",
      "2 tsp  vanilla bean paste"
    ],
    "steps": "Mix the soya milk with the lemon juice in a jug and set aside for a few minutes to thicken. Cut 150g of the marzipan from the larger block. Roll this out on a work surface lightly dusted with icing sugar until it's just slightly smaller than the base of a 23cm cake tin. Using the dairy-free spread, butter a 23cm springform cake tin and line with a double layer of baking parchment. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Mix the dried fruit, lemon zest, chopped cherries and orange zest and juice together in a large bowl, tossing a few times until well combined. Beat the vegan spread with the brown sugar until pale using an electric whisk, then add the flour, almonds, baking powder, spices and vanilla. Tip in the milk mixture until you have a smooth batter. Fold in the fruit along with a pinch of salt and any juice from the bowl until well combined – don’t worry if the batter looks slightly curdled. Spoon half the batter into the prepared tin, then gently smooth the surface with the back of the spoon and top with the round of marzipan. Spoon over the remaining batter and smooth the surface again. Bake for 30 mins, then reduce the oven to 150C/130C fan/gas 2 and bake for another 1 hr 45 mins-2 hrs, or until a skewer comes out clean and the cake is well-risen and firm. Carefully remove from the tin and leave to cool completely on a wire rack. Cut into slices to serve. Will keep for two weeks in an airtight container. Brush the warm apricot jam over the cooled cake. Cut a 200g piece from the remaining marzipan and roll it out again as before. Cut out a 23cm circle using the base of the cake tin as a guide. Use the rolling pin to help you lift the marzipan circle over the cake and gently press it onto the surface (the apricot jam will help it stick). Divide the remaining marzipan into 11 pieces and roll into balls. Use a little more jam to stick the balls around the edge of the cake – these represent the 12 apostles, minus Judas. If you like, use a kitchen blowtorch to slightly burnish the marzipan balls and topping until just golden (do this carefully so they don't burn).",

Stuff the cheese and peppers inside the pocket and close by gently pressing it down. Pop it back into the toaster on a medium setting (or under the grill) with the open side upwards. Toss the watercress in a drizzling of your favourite dressing or some olive oil. When the pitta pops up, cut it in half for easy eating, or leave it as it is. Allow it to cool for a moment as it is quite hot at first. Serve with the watercress and have a napkin at the ready – the yummy pepper juices may leak when you take the first bite.",

Stir every now and then until melted. (Alternatively, melt in the microwave, stirring the chocolate every 20 secs so it doesn’t burn.) Remove the bowl from the heat and leave to cool a little. Meanwhile, put the butter and icing sugar in another large bowl and mash with a spatula to combine (this will prevent you covering the work surface in icing sugar), then whisk with a hand mixer until smooth.

Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl until light and smooth. Gradually beat in the eggs until combined, then mix in the vanilla. Fold in the flour and baking powder to fully combine. Stir in the milk to loosen. Divide the mixture between the three tins, and bake the sponges for 20 mins until golden and a skewer inserted into the centre of each cake comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tins for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the Swiss meringue buttercream. Put the egg whites and sugar in a heatproof bowl set over a small pan of gently simmering water, ensuring the bowl doesn’t touch the water. Whisk for 3-4 mins until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and tip the mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer, or use an electric whisk, and whisk for 10 mins on a medium-high speed until you have a thick meringue. Gradually whisk in the softened butter 1 tbsp at a time until fully incorporated and the buttercream is fluffy. Mixin the vanilla extract. Put one of the sponges on a plate or cake stand, top it with 3-4 tbsp of the buttercream and spread out so that it’s thicker at the edge. Add half of either the caramel or lemon curd and spread over the icing on the middle part of the cake – don't spread to the edges. Add the next sponge, and repeat. Top with the final sponge. Smooth a thin layer of the buttercream around the cake – this is called a crumb coat. Chill in the fridge for at least 45 mins, then smooth another layer of buttercream around the cake using a palette knife to fully cover the sponge, reserving half for decoration. Put the cake and reserved buttercream back in the fridge for another 45 mins-1 hr. Divide the remaining buttercream between 11 small bowls and mix in a different gel colouring to 10 of them, leaving the last bowl white. Use a different piping bag for each colour, either cutting a 1cm hole in the end or applying a round nozzle. Pipe one row of buttercream blobs in alternating colours from the top to the bottom of the cake, then use a teaspoon or small palette knife to very lightly smear each blob of frosting away from you. For the second row, choose the colour that is next in sequence to the colour alongside it, piping over the thinnest part of that smeared blob. As you continue to pipe around the cake following this pattern, you will create a swirl effect of colours. Continue the previous piping method in a circle on top of the cake, but this time smearing the icing in towards the middle of the cake until the cake is covered, then it's ready to slice and serve. The cake will keep in an airtight container for up to three days.",

To make the sponge, beat the butter and sugar together in a stand mixer or using an electric whisk for 5-8 mins or until light and fluffy. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Fold in the flour, baking powder and milk to loosen. Divide the mixture between three mixing bowls, weighing for accuracy if you like. Colour one of the batters blue and another pink, starting with a little colouring, then adding more for a deeper finish. Leave one of the bowls of batter uncoloured. Get the three cake tins and bowls of batter ready in front of you. Spoon a heaped tablespoon of blue batter into the centre of the first tin, then pink in the second, and plain in the third. Working quickly so that it doesn’t spread too much, add another dollop of a different coloured batter on top of each one. Don’t wait for the batter to settle or spread, just keep alternating the colours until you run out. The weight of each layer will cause the batter to spread as you go, so very gently tap and shake the cake tins to even out the mixture, then bake in the centre of the oven for 25-30 mins or until firm to the touch. Turn out top-side down onto wire racks straightaway, then leave to cool completely. For the icing, put the butter, icing sugar and vanilla seeds into a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or put in a bowl and use an electric whisk. Beat for 5 mins or until fluffy and aerated. Add the cream cheese and beat briefly until just combined. Place one of the cakes on a cake stand or serving plate and spread 2 tbsp of the buttercream on top, then repeat with the other sponges. Spread a smooth layer of the icing over the top and sides of the cake, using a large palette knife, leaving some slightly less iced spots for a ‘naked’ finish. Top with sprinkles and candles, if you like. Will keep in an airtight tin for three days.",

    "steps": "Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil three 20cm cake tins and line with baking parchment. Weigh out the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarb and sugar into a large bowl, add a pinch of salt and whisk gently to combine. Shake the bowl to bring any lumps of sugar to the surface and squeeze these with your fingertips. Measure the oil, milk, vinegar, coffee and vanilla into a jug, then add the eggs and whisk to combine. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir with a whisk until smooth, making sure there are no pockets of flour at the bottom of the bowl – the mixture will be quite runny. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared tins, then bake on the middle shelf of the oven (or middle and top if they don’t all fit on one shelf) for 25 mins. Swap the tins around and bake 5 mins more. Check the cakes are cooked by inserting a skewer into the centre of each – if any wet batter clings to the skewer, return the tins to the oven for another 5 mins, then check again. Leave to cool in the tins for 30 mins, then turn the sponges out onto wire racks to cool completely. If making ahead, wrap the cooled sponges well and store in an airtight container for up to three days, or the freezer for up to two months. For the buttercream, beat the butter using an electric whisk or in a stand mixer for a few minutes until smooth and creamy. Add half the icing sugar and beat again to combine. Add the remaining icing sugar, the vanilla and 4 tbsp milk and beat again to combine, adding a splash more milk if needed to make a smooth, fluffy buttercream. Divide between three bowls. Add a few drops of different food colouring paste to each bowl, then mix well – we used pastel pink, purple and yellow. Spoon the coloured buttercream mixtures into three separate piping bags and snip off the tips. Pipe a dot of buttercream onto a cake stand or board and place a sponge on top to help keep it in place. Pipe small blobs of purple buttercream all over the top of the sponge by holding the piping bag directly above the cake, about ½cm from the surface, and squeezing the bag while pulling upwards to create a small peak. Place the second sponge on top, then repeat the process with the pink buttercream. Add the third sponge on top, then neatly pipe blobs of yellow buttercream over the surface. Decorate with edible flowers, sugared almonds or mini chocolate eggs, if you like. Will keep in a tin at room temperature for up to five days.",

    "steps": "Start by making the unicorn's horn and ears – they'll need to dry completely before use. Roll 225g white fondant into a long sausage shape, with one end slightly thicker than the other. Starting from the thicker end, twist the sausage into a tight coil until you have a horn shape. Pinch the small end upwards into a pointed tip. Next, divide the remaining white fondant into two pieces. Roll each one out into a rough oval on a sheet of baking parchment, then pinch the top end of each oval upwards to make a point. Set the ears aside with the horn and leave to dry while you make the cake. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter the base of three 20cm sandwich tins and line with baking parchment. Beat the butter, sugar and vanilla together in a large bowl with an electric whisk for 8-10 mins until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Sift in the flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt, and fold in using a large metal spoon. Add just enough of the milk to create a soft dropping consistency. Divide the batter between the prepared tins and smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 25-30 mins, or until golden and firm to the touch. Leave to cool slightly in the tins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. While the cake is cooling, make the buttercream. Beat the butter, icing sugar and vanilla together until pale and fluffy, beating in 4-6 tbsp hot water to loosen the mixture if necessary. Put one of the cooled sponges on a cake board or stand and spread a little of the buttercream on top using a palette knife. Gently spread over half the salted caramel, if using, then sandwich with another sponge. Repeat the process with a little more buttercream, the remaining salted caramel (if using) and the third sponge. Spread the outside of the cake with a thin layer of buttercream – this doesn't have to be neat. Chill for 30 mins. Spread a thick, even layer of buttercream over the chilled cake using a palette knife. Divide the remaining buttercream into three bowls and colour each one differently using the gel food colouring. Ours were light pink, purple and dark pink. Put a little gold lustre dust into a bowl, add a drop of water and stir to make a gold paste. Using a small paintbrush, paint the unicorn horn gold using the paste, as well as the inside of the ears, if you like. Carefully place the gold horn in the middle of the iced cake, with the ears on either side. Fit three piping bags with three different nozzles (we used a round nozzle and two different sized star nozzles) and fill each with a different colour of buttercream. Pipe each colour around the ears and horn and all over the top of the cake, coming down one side and over the edge of the front – this is the unicorn's mane. Decorate with some sprinkles, if using. Divide the black fondant in two pieces, and roll each into a thin sausage shape. Shape each into an arch, then press onto the front of the cake for eyes. If you like, curve the outer edges of the eyes upwards for eyelashes. Cut into slices and serve. Will keep in the fridge for up to three days.",

    ],
    "steps": "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease two 20cm cake tins (one should be at least 8cm deep) with oil, and line the base and sides with baking parchment. Tip the egg yolks, caster sugar and vanilla into a large bowl, and the egg whites into a second large bowl. Combine the flour, almonds and 1 /4 tsp salt in a third bowl. Using an electric hand whisk, beat the egg whites until doubled in size and holding soft peaks. Transfer the beaters to the egg yolk bowl (no need to clean the beaters first) and whisk until the mixture is thick and pale. Lift the beaters and drizzle the mixture around the bowl – a ribbon should sit on the surface for 2-3 secs. With a large metal spoon, transfer a spoonful of egg white to the yolks, and mix to loosen the consistency. Add the remaining whites and gently fold into the yolks, trying to retain as much volume as possible. Stop before the mixture is totally combined. Sprinkle the flour and almond mixture evenly over the surface, then drizzle the cooled butter around the edge of the bowl. Fold everything together until just combined, making sure you scoop the spoon right down to the bottom of the bowl to catch the butter and any pockets of flour. Divide the mixture between the cake tins, level the surfaces, then bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 22-25 mins. Test the cakes are done by inserting a skewer into the centre – it should come out clean. Cool in their tins on a wire rack for 30 mins, then remove the tins and parchment, and leave to cool completely. Boil the kettle. Put the gelatine in a bowl of cold water and set aside to soften. Pour 150ml cream and 50ml hot water into a saucepan. Add the matcha powder and whisk over a gentle heat until well combined and steaming. Remove from the heat. Squeeze the water from the gelatine leaves and add them, one by one, to the hot matcha cream, whisking until they’re dissolved. Pour the warm cream into a bowl and put in the fridge to cool to room temperature – don’t leave it too long or the gelatine will set. Line the deepest of your 20cm cake tins with a double layer of cling film, ensuring the sides are well covered. Put one of the sponges in the tin, flattest-side down. Pour the remaining 450ml cream into a bowl and add the icing sugar. Whip until the cream is holding soft peaks, then fold through the cooled matcha cream. Scrape the cream into the cake tin and level the surface. Put the remaining sponge on top, flattest-side facing up, pushing the sponge gently into the cream. Wrap the tin in cling film and chill for at least 4 hrs. Put the cream, chocolate and matcha powder in a saucepan and heat very gently, stirring until the chocolate has melted and the matcha is well mixed in. Set aside to cool and thicken for 10 mins. Remove the cake from the fridge and unwrap the tin. Invert the cake onto a cake stand or plate and remove from the tin and the cling film. Using a palette knife held at a 90-degree angle to the side of the cake, scrape around the edge to remove any excess mousse and give the cake a smooth finish. Using baking parchment, create a tight collar, sitting about 2cm taller than the cake. Pour the cooled chocolate glaze over the top, smoothing it to the edge – the collar should prevent it from dribbling down the sides. Chill for 30 mins more, or for up to 24 hrs. Carefully pull off the parchment collar. Hold a chopping board (or another object with a straight edge) over half the cake and dust the exposed surface with icing sugar. Arrange fresh cherries and cherry blossom or another edible flower on top, if you like, and serve immediately.",

    "steps": "If you're making the mermaid tails, melt the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl in 20-second bursts in the microwave, stirring after each turn. Pour into the tail moulds and small shells, and put on a small tray flat in the freezer for 15-20 mins until set. You can repeat this for four tails if you only have one mould. Once set, remove from the mould, mix the lustre with ¼ tsp of water and paint it onto the mermaid tails (see tip, below). Put back on a plate or tray in the freezer until needed. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter and line the base of three 18cm sandwich cake tins with baking parchment. Using a stand mixer or electric hand whisk, beat together the butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla, baking powder and flour until you have a fluffy mix. Divide the mixture evenly between three bowls and mix a few drops of colouring into each bowl until fully combined, making each bowl a different shade of purple, getting lighter. Pour each coloured sponge mix into separate tins and smooth over the tops. Bake for 25-30 mins until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. After 10 mins, remove the cakes from their tins and transfer to a cooling rack, top-side facing down, and leave to cool. Don’t worry if the outside doesn’t look purple, the inside will! While the cake is cooling, make the icing. Beat together the icing sugar and butter until pale and fluffy, mixing in 1 tbsp warm water to loosen the mixture if necessary. Set half of the icing aside in a bowl. Divide the other half of the icing between three bowls and colour each a different shade of blue, a dark, medium and light. Stack the sponges, spreading most of the white icing over each one using a palette knife, then use the palette knife to roughly coat the outside of the cakes with the remaining white icing to create a crumb coat. Chill for 30 mins. Put each of the blue icing shades in separate piping bags and cut a large 2cm hole at the bottom. Starting with the dark shade at the bottom of the cake, pipe an even ring onto the whole cake, two-three times around. Continue working your way up the cake with the icing getting lighter as you reach the top of the cake. Using a small palette knife, work your way around the join in between each row, gently pushing to join each line together. Save some icing in the piping bags to decorate the top. Smooth over the cake with a large palette knife or cake scraper to create a smooth ombre icing, keeping the excess to decorate the top. You can either mix all the leftover icing together and put in a clean piping bag with a star nozzle to get a multicoloured effect, or pipe individual shades on the top. Add a few dots around the top of the cake in the varying blue colours to look like waves (using some of the white to look like the top of a crashing wave), and dot around the pearls, sprinkles, shells and mermaid tails, pushing them into the icing on the side of the cake, and on top to finish.",

    ],
    "steps": "First make the malt sponges. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease and line the bases of 2 x 20cm cake tins with baking parchment. Put the butter and sugar in a large bowl and whisk until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking well between each addition. Tip the flour, malt and baking powder into the bowl with ¼ tsp salt and fold together, then add the yogurt and vanilla, and give everything a final stir. Divide the cake mixture between the 2 tins, level the tops and bake on the middle shelf for 25-30 mins or until a skewer pushed into the centre of the cakes comes out clean. Cool for 10 mins, then remove from the tins, peel off the baking parchment and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Wash the tins. Now make the chocolate sponges. Grease and line the base of the tins as before and boil the kettle. In the same bowl (don’t worry about washing it), cream the butter and sugar as before, adding the eggs, one at a time, and mixing until combined. Sift in the flour, cocoa and baking powder with ¼ tsp salt. Fold the mixture together, then add the yogurt, melted chocolate and 100ml boiling water. Stir until combined, then divide between the tins. Bake for 25-30 mins, testing with a skewer as before. Cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out, remove the baking parchment and cool completely. The sponges can be made up to 2 days before being iced, cooled and wrapped tightly in cling film. Make the honeycomb. Grease a baking tray with a little butter or oil. Put the sugar and golden syrup in a large pan. Warm over a medium heat and leave to bubble to a liquid caramel, but don’t stir. When you’re happy with the colour (the darker it gets, the more intense the flavour will be), add the bicarbonate of soda and quickly stir into the syrup. Before the bubbles die down, pour the foaming mixture onto the baking tray, then set aside for 30 mins to cool and firm up. Make the icing. In your largest mixing bowl, beat the butter with half the icing sugar, the malt and vanilla until smooth. Add the remaining icing sugar and the cream cheese, and beat again until well combined – don’t overmix or the icing may become runny. You’re now ready to assemble. Put one of the sponges on a cake stand or cake board, sticking it down with a small blob of icing. Use ¼ of the icing to stack the cakes, alternating between the malt and chocolate sponges. Place the final sponge on top, flat-side up. When assembled, use a palette knife to cover the entire cake with a thin layer of the icing, filling any gaps between sponges, but don’t worry about completely covering the sponges at this stage. This is called a crumb coat and ensures that your final layer is crumb-free. Make space in your fridge and chill the cake for 30 mins to firm up the icing. Once the icing is chilled, use the remaining icing to completely cover the cake. This is easiest if you pile the icing on top of the cake, then use a palette knife to ease it over the edge and down the sides. You can make it as smooth or as rough as you like. Chill for another 30 mins. Make the drizzle. Meanwhile, put the dark chocolate in a bowl and heat the cream in a small pan until just steaming. Pour the cream over the chocolate and leave to melt for 5-10 mins. Stir to make a glossy ganache, then set aside to firm up a little – you want the ganache to be pourable but not too runny, to make drizzly droplets down the side of the cake. When the ganache is the correct consistency, remove the cake from the fridge and spoon the ganache over the top edge of the cake, encouraging it to drizzle down the side with your spoon – start at the back of the cake to get the hang of it. Fill in the middle of the top of the cake with chocolate too. Break the honeycomb into tall shards and stack them on top of the cake. Finish with whole and halved Maltesers, adding a few around the base, along with some honeycomb crumbs. The cake is best served within 2-3 hrs of assembling, but will still taste delicious for up to 3 days. Store leftovers in the fridge and allow to come back to room temperature before serving.",

    "steps": "Put the sliced and halved strawberries for the filling and decoration into a small bowl and pour over the Pimm's. Leave to soak in for at least one hour or overnight. Heat oven to 190C /170C fan/gas 5. Line 3 x 20cm sandwich tins with baking parchment and grease with butter. Cut the whole cucumber in half lengthways and using a teaspoon scrape out and discard the seeds. Roughly chop the rest of the cucumber and puree in a blender with the lemon juice. In a large bowl and using electric beaters whisk up the softened butter with the sugar until pale and light. Continue whisking as you add the eggs, one at a time, whisking in between additions. Once all the eggs have been added pour in the cucumber purée, lemon zest and vanilla extract. Don’t worry if the mixture splits - it will come back together when you add the flour. Fold in the flour and baking powder and whisk once again briefly until there are no lumps of flour remaining then divide the mixture between the three tins. Bake in the oven for 30-35mins or until a skewer pushed into the middle of the cakes comes out clean. Take the cakes out of the oven and leave to cool in their tins for five minutes then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely. While the cakes are cooking and cooling make the buttercreams. To make the strawberry buttercream, mash the strawberries in a small bowl with a fork until mushy. In a larger bowl whisk up the butter and half the icing sugar until smooth, then whisk in the mashed strawberries followed by the remaining icing sugar. Whisk until smooth and pale pink and place in the fridge until needed. Repeat the process with the lemon buttercream. Once the cakes are completely cold, put one of the cakes onto a cake turntable and add about one third of the lemon buttercream, spread over the surface evenly then top with half of the soaked strawberry slices. Next, spread one third of the strawberry buttercream onto another of the cakes and top with the remaining strawberry slices. Carefully stack the two filled layers with the final cake on top. Transfer the remaining buttercreams to disposable piping bags and snip off the ends. Pipe the strawberry buttercream in rings around the outside of the cake, starting at the base. Once you reach three quarters of the way up, switch to the lemon buttercream and continue piping onto the top of the cake. Smooth over the top using a palette knife then smooth the sides with either a large palette knife or, better still a pastry scraper. Use long sweeping movements and gently turn the cake turntable so that you get a smooth finish but a subtle gradient effect where the two colours meet. Scrape any excess icing into a bowl. To finish, top with the remaining soaked strawberry halves and the slices of cucumber.",

    "steps": "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease and line two x 23cm tins with baking parchment. Beat the butter, sugar and vanilla in a tabletop mixer (or with a hand mixer or wooden spoon) until the mixture is very light, pale and fluffy.  Gradually mix in the beaten eggs, scraping down the side of the bowl after each addition, until fully combined. If using a mixer, on slow, add the flour until just combined - don't over-beat as it can make the sponge heavy. If you're not using a mixer, fold in the flour with a large metal spoon.  Divide the mixture between the tins and bake in the oven for 30 mins or until the cakes come away from the side and the skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Remove and cool in the tin for 5 mins. Turn out onto a wire rack and remove the parchment to allow the steam to escape and the cakes to cool. Meanwhile, make the decorations.  Now assemble your cake. Before you split the sponges, trim the domed tops off each cake with a bread knife. Use the same knife or a cake wire, to split each sponge horizontally, so you're left with four sponge layers. A good tip is to cut a marker line on each sponge using a bread knife, so that once you've cut the sponges and filled them, you can use the line to put them back together in the right place. That way, if your cutting was a little wonky, it won't make the cake uneven.  Whip the double cream with the icing sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy, and just holding shape. Put the bottom layer on a cake stand or board. Spread with a thin layer of jam, then spread or pipe on a good layer of cream. Arrange an even layer of strawberries neatly round the edge, then dot the middle of the sponge with more fruit. Repeat with two more of the cake layers. For the top layer, add the sponge and jam, but neatly pipe the cream over. Gently press gold leaf onto the chocolate on the strawberries, a few meringues and some of the bark.  Arrange the chocolate-coated strawberries on top of the creamy sponge, then nestle in shards of bark, meringues and biscuit. Finish with a sprinkling of crushed meringue and a little more of the freeze-dried strawberries (from the chocolate bark recipe). Serve and eat within a few hours. ",

Put the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, sugar and 1 tsp salt in a bowl and mix well. If there are any lumps in the sugar, squeeze these through your fingers to break them up. Measure the buttermilk, coffee, oil and vanilla in a jug. Add the egg and whisk until smooth. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk until well combined. Pour the cake mixture evenly into the two tins, and bake for 25-30 mins until risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack, peel off the baking parchment and leave to cool. These sponges can be made up to three days ahead and will stay moist if wrapped in cling film, or you can wrap well and freeze for up to two months. To make the chocolate fudge icing, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl, suspended over a pan of barely simmering water. Stir every now and then until melted. (Alternatively, melt in the microwave, stirring the chocolate every 20 secs so it doesn’t burn.) Remove the bowl from the heat and leave to cool a little. Meanwhile, put the butter and icing sugar in another large bowl and mash with a spatula to combine (this will prevent you covering the work surface in icing sugar), then whisk with a hand mixer until smooth. Sift in the cocoa and pour in the melted chocolate and milk, then mix again until smooth. Use roughly half the icing to sandwich the cakes together on a cake stand or board. Use a palette knife to cover the entire cake with the remaining icing – don’t worry about being too neat. Use the chocolate fingers to cover the sides of the cakes – do this straight after icing as the icing will set after a while, and the chocolate fingers won’t stick. Melt the remaining 50g chocolate in the microwave or in a small bowl suspended over a pan of gently simmering water. Leave to cool until the chocolate is a spreadable consistency. You can speed this up by putting it in the fridge – just stir it every 5 mins or so to prevent the chocolate from setting. Push a skewer into the centre of the cake and slip the straw over the top – this will give it more stability. Push 1-2cm of the straw into the cake. Use a cutlery knife to spread a blob of chocolate onto a sugar coated chocolate sweet and, starting at the base, stick the sweets to the straw. You will have to do this in stages to allow the chocolate to set a little before adding another layer of sweets. Work your way up the straw until it’s completely covered. If the chocolate in your bowl becomes too firm, simply heat again until it is at the correct consistency. Stop when you reach the bend in the straw. Stick the remaining skewer into the top of the straw so that it pokes out at an angle. Place the paper bag on top – you may have to use a little sticky tape to hold it in place. If any of the straw is exposed, cover it with more sweets. Tip the remaining sweets on top of the cake to flood the surface. Will keep well stored in an airtight tin for 2 days.",

    "steps": "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease and line two 20cm cake tins with baking parchment – if your cake tins are quite shallow, line the sides to a depth of at least 5cm. Put 200g flour, 8 tbsp cocoa powder, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda, 280g light brown soft sugar and 1 tsp salt in a bowl and mix well. If there are any lumps in the sugar, squeeze these through your fingers to break them up. Measure 200ml buttermilk, 100ml coffee, 150ml oil and 2 tsp vanilla in a jug. Add 2 eggs and whisk until smooth. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk until well combined. Pour the cake mixture evenly into the two tins, and bake for 25-30 mins until risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack, peel off the baking parchment and leave to cool. Repeat steps 1 and 2, so that you have 4 sponge cakes in total. These sponges can be made up to three days ahead and will stay moist if wrapped in cling film, or you can wrap well and freeze for up to two months. To make the icing, put the butter in a large bowl and sieve in half the icing sugar. Roughly mash together with a spatula, then whizz with a hand mixer until smooth. Add the cream cheese and sieve in the remaining icing sugar, mash together again, then blend once more with the hand mixer. Put the biscuits in a food processor and whizz to fine crumbs. Add the biscuit crumbs to the icing and mix again until combined. Next, make the cookie cake toppers. You’ll need one biscuit for each letter of the word you’d like to write – someone’s name or, like we have done, ‘WOW!’ Carefully insert a skewer into the creamy filling in the middle of each biscuit – some cookies may break, so save these ones for later. Melt the chocolate in the microwave, stirring every 20 secs or so, or in a heatproof bowl suspended over a pan of gently simmering water. Spread a little chocolate over the surface of one side of each cookie. Roll out the fondant icing to the thickness of a 50p coin, and cut out your letters, then stick these to the cookies and set aside to dry. Alternatively, let the chocolate dry, then use an icing pen to write the name or word directly on the surface. To assemble the cake, stick one of your sponges to a cake stand or board with a little of the cream cheese icing. Use roughly half the icing to stack the remaining cakes on top, spreading a generous amount between each layer. Pile the remaining icing on top of the assembled cake, and use a palette knife to ease it over the edges, covering the entire surface of the cake. Tidy the plate with a piece of kitchen paper. If you have any leftover biscuits, break them into pieces and push these around the base of the cake. Insert the dried cookie cake toppers into the top of the cake and serve. Store leftovers in the fridge for up to 2 days, but bring back to room temperature for an hour or so before eating.",

    ],
    "steps": "Start by making the cake. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly grease a 23cm deep round cake pan, lining the base with parchment paper. Cream the butter and sugar together in a large bowl using an electric hand whisk until light and fluffy – this should take about 10 mins. Add the vanilla and whisk again to combine. Beat the eggs a little with a fork, and with the beaters still running, add the eggs a little bit at a time. Wait until each addition has been fully combined before adding more. Once all of the eggs have been added, fold in the flour with a spatula in three additions, alternating with the yogurt. If the finished batter feels a little stiff, mix in a couple tbsp of milk to loosen it. Transfer the batter into the prepared cake pan and level out with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for about 1 hr 30 – 1 hr 40 mins or until a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. If the cake is browning too quickly, cover loosely with baking parchment for the last 15 mins of cooking. Allow the cake to cool in the tin for 20 mins. While the cake is cooling in the tin make the syrup. Place the sugar, 50ml water and vanilla extract into a small saucepan over a medium heat and bring to a simmer, cooking for a few mins until the sugar has dissolved. Transfer the cake onto a wire rack to cool completely then use a skewer to poke holes all over the top of the cake. Use a pastry brush to spread the syrup over the top of the cake, allowing it to soak into the sponge before adding more. To make the buttercream, beat the butter and icing sugar together with an electric hand whisk until light and fluffy, then add the orange curd and whisk again to combine. If the cake is domed on the top, use a large serrated knife to level it off then cut the cake through the middle, into two layers. Place the bottom layer of cake onto a 23cm round cake board and spread a thin layer of buttercream on the cake and top with the raspberry jam. Place the second layer of cake on top and spread the remaining buttercream over the top and sides of the cake. On a work surface lightly dusted with icing sugar, knead the red sugarpaste until soft and pliable. Roll it out until about 3-4mm thick and wide enough to cover the cake. Roll the sugarpaste onto the rolling pin and carefully drape over the cake. Gently smooth the sugarpaste down the sides of the cake and trim off the excess with a small sharp knife. Reserve the trimmings for the details later on. Repeat the rolling process with the yellow sugarpaste but this time cutting into thin strips. Cut 30 strips approx 1.5cm x 10cm and stick to the sides of the cake all the way around, dipping your finger in water to brush onto the back of each one, which will act as glue (the strips should cover the entire height of the cake but only reach a couple of centimetres over the top of cake). Next roll out the blue sugarpaste to the same thickness as the red and yellow but this time cut out a 20cm circle and stick it in place in the middle of the cake using a little water. Roll out the brown sugarpaste as well and use a thin sharp knife to cut out Duggee’s face and attach to the blue circle. For Duggee’s clothes knead a little yellow into the remaining brown sugarpaste until it is a light brown colour and use this to cut out his shirt and lip area, sticking with a little water as before. Use the black sugarpaste to roll his eyes and nose, using your hands rather than rolling on the work surface. Use the remaining sugarpaste to shape the decorations for his outfit and mouth and stick as before with a little water. Wrap the ribbon around the bottom edge of the cake and secure with tape or a pin but remember to remove before serving. This cake will keep in a sealed container for up to 4 days.",

Grease and line a 2lb loaf tin with baking parchment (our tin was 22 x 7 x 7cm). In a bowl, mix the flour, bicarbonate of soda, ground ginger, cinnamon and 1⁄2 tsp salt. Pour in the warm syrup mixture and the milk, followed by the egg yolks. Whisk until you have a smooth batter. Pour into the tin and bake for 1 hr or until a skewer comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 30 mins, then slice off the top to give you a smooth surface. Flip onto a wire rack and remove the baking parchment. Leave to cool. Can now be covered with cling film and kept for up to 5 days. To make the buttercream, put the ingredients in a large bowl and mash together with a fork or spatula (this prevents the icing sugar from going everywhere). When roughly combined, blend with an electric hand whisk until smooth. Now make the marshmallow icing. Put the egg whites, sugar, 1 tbsp water and a good pinch of salt into a heatproof bowl. Place over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bowl doesn’t touch the hot water, and whisk until thick and leaving a prominent trail from the beaters – this will take about 4 mins. Remove the bowl from the heat and continue whisking for another 3 mins until cooled slightly and really stiff. Transfer half to a piping bag fitted with a large round nozzle and set aside. When ready to assemble, slice the cake lengthways into 3 even layers. On a cake stand or plate, reassemble the cake, with the largest slice on the bottom, layering with the buttercream. Using a small offset palette knife or small butter knife, cover the cake with the marshmallow icing left in the bowl. Use the palette knife to create vertical lines along the edges (see tip, left). Now use the piping bag to pipe spikes of meringue over the top of the cake. Use a cook’s blowtorch to toast the meringue to a golden brown – a few charred patches will add to the effect. Serve straight away or chill for up to 2 days, removing from the fridge 30 mins before serving. We decorated ours with sparklers.",

      "½ tsp baking powder",
      "½ tsp bicarbonate of soda",

      "2 chocolate chips",
      "2 gold or silver balls"
    ],
    "steps": "Heat the oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Grease and base line a 1 litre heatproof glass pudding basin and a 450g loaf tin with baking parchment. Put the butter and chocolate into a saucepan and melt over a low heat, stirring. When the chocolate has all melted remove from the heat. In a large bowl mix together the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and muscovado sugar. In another bowl beat together the eggs, soured cream and vanilla extract. Pour the egg and chocolate mixtures into the flour and mix thoroughly together. Weigh 250g into the loaf tin, then spoon the rest of the mixture into the pudding basin. Cook both cakes side by side in the oven. The loaf cake will cook in about 30 mins and the basin cake in about 1 hour. Take the loaf cake out of the oven and close the oven door quickly so as not to allow the heat out. Test with a skewer inserted into the centre, it should come out clean. If not return to the oven for another five mins. Repeat with the basin cake after about another half an hour. Once each cake is cooked, allow to cool completely before turning out. To make the icing, mix together the cocoa and water to make a smooth paste. Beat the butter until soft and gradually beat in the icing sugar. Add the cocoa paste and beat until smooth. To assemble the cake, trim the top of the basin cake so it is flat. Turn cut side down onto a board and cut in half vertically. Spread a little butter icing on each of the flat bases and sandwich these two buttercreamed surfaces together to make a rugby ball shape for the hedgehog body. Place onto a 30cm cake board or wooden board. Cut the loaf cake in half vertically. Take one half and trim the short end to a v shape to make the pointy head. Use a little icing to attach to the body. Cut pieces from the remaining loaf cake to fill any gaps. Cover the whole cake in butter icing. Cut the flake bars into pieces ranging from 2.5cm to 5cm. The spikes do not have to be regular or even in shape. Starting at the front push the spikes into the body of the hedgehog at a slight angle. Start with the small pieces gradually using larger ones as you go towards the back. Press a round chocolate into the tip of the head to represent the nose and use chocolate chips for the eyes. Using a tiny bit of butter icing attach sliver or gold balls to the eyes. The cake is best made the day before cutting and icing and will keep well for 3–4 days.",

    ],
    "steps": "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and grease 3 x 20cm sandwich tins, lining the bases with baking parchment and greasing the parchment too. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric whisk until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla extract and the egg whites, a little at a time, beating until fully combined before adding more. Mix together the flour, cornflour and baking powder. Add the dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with the buttermilk. Divide the batter between the tins and level the tops. Bake for 25-30 mins or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack, peeling off the parchment. Cool completely. To make the buttercream, put the egg whites and sugar in a big bowl (the bowl of your tabletop mixer, if you have one) with the vanilla seeds and set over a pan of gently simmering water. Lightly whisk until the sugar has fully dissolved – you can test this by dipping two fingers into the bowl and rubbing them together; if you can’t feel any grains of sugar, the mixture is ready. Remove the bowl from the heat and keep whisking until a thick meringue has formed. Continue whisking until the meringue has cooled to room temperature, then slowly add in the butter, 1 tbsp at a time. By the time all the butter has been incorporated, the mixture should have transformed into a silky-smooth buttercream. If it hasn’t, continue to whisk until it does. If it still refuses to thicken, it may be the mixture is still too warm, so chill for 10 mins, then continue whisking. Add the vanilla extract and mix to combine. To assemble the cake, place a sponge on a cake board or serving plate and top with a thin layer of buttercream. Repeat with the remaining cake layers and finish by spreading the remaining buttercream over the top and sides of the cake (see below). To get a smooth finish, use the edge of a palette knife, and drag carefully around the sides of the cake, smoothing out the buttercream. To decorate the cake, press the sides of it with the edible polka dot sprinkles creating a full border at the bottom with less and less the further up the cake you go. Best served within 2 days of baking, but the cake will keep for up to 4 days.",

Stir in the dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with the milk. Divide the batter among the prepared tins, smooth the surfaces and bake for 25-30 mins or until a skewer inserted into the middle of the cakes comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack, peeling off the parchment, to cool completely. For the caramelised pears, peel, core and dice them into small cubes, tossing with the lemon juice as you go. Tip into a frying pan with the maple syrup and butter, and cook over a medium-high heat until the pears have softened and most of the liquid has evaporated. Set aside to cool. For the buttercream, put the egg whites and sugar in a large heatproof bowl (the bowl of your tabletop mixer, if you have one) and place over a pan of gently simmering water. Whisk until the sugar has fully dissolved - you can test this by dipping two fingers into the bowl and rubbing them together; if you can’t feel any grains of sugar, the mixture is ready. Remove the bowl from the pan and beat with an electric whisk (or use your tabletop mixer) until a thick meringue has formed. Continue whisking until the meringue has cooled to room temperature.

If it still refuses to thicken, it may be the mixture is still too warm, so chill for 10 mins, then continue whisking. Whisk in the maple syrup last. To assemble the cake, place the first sponge on a cake board or serving plate and spread with a thin layer of the buttercream. Top with half of the caramelised pear chunks, discarding any leftover liquid. Repeat, finishing with the third sponge. To finish, spread a very thin layer of the buttercream over the sides and top of the cake – this is called ‘crumb-coating’ (see tip). Now spread a thick layer of buttercream on top of the cake. Put the remaining buttercream in a piping bag fitted with a small petal piping tip (see tip). Hold the piping bag with the wide end of the nozzle touching the side of the cake, at the very bottom. Gently wiggle the bag side to side, back and forth, in a zigzag motion, working up the cake in a strip. Repeat, starting next to the previous strip each time, working all the way around the cake until it’s entirely covered. To finish, pipe 1 row of buttercream around the edge of the top of the cake (which will neaten any rough edges at the top of your zigzags). If you like a little sparkle, finish the cake with a coat of edible gold spray. Best served within 2 days of baking, but the cake will keep for up to 4 days.",

Put one sponge on a cake stand or serving plate, and pipe just under half the icing around the edge using a circular motion for a wavy effect. Pipe a little more icing over the empty middle (this doesn’t need to be neat) and smooth with the back of a spoon. Chill for 45 mins-1 hr until set. Top with the second sponge, then pipe eight blobs of icing around the edge at regular intervals, leaving a gap between each. Spoon the candied lemon zest into each gap, then serve.",

To make the icing, put the butter, icing sugar and 100ml of the syrup in a large bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon, then switch to an electric whisk and whisk until smooth and fluffy. Divide the mixture between three bowls. Add a tiny dot of food colouring gel to each bowl to make three different colours of buttercream – stir to mix, then transfer half of each colour to disposable piping bags. Use a cocktail stick to poke a few little holes in the top of the cupcakes, then drizzle each with 1 tsp of the syrup. Put 1 heaped tsp of icing onto each cake (do eight of each colour) and swirl it round with the back of the spoon to completely cover the top. Next, use the matching piping bag to pipe a straight line about 2-3 cm long across the middle of each cake. To make the wings, melt the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Divide into three smaller bowls and add the same gel colours as before. Cut 8cm squares of baking parchment and, using a pen, draw a pair of butterfly wings on each square so that the design shows through on the other side or, if you prefer, trace the design below. Turn the paper over and, using the line as a guide, paint on the melted chocolate. Sprinkle crushed biscuits on the edges to create patterns, then leave to set. Once set, gently push the wings into the cupcakes at a 45-degree angle.",

    "steps": "Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, ensuring the bowl doesn’t touch the water. Alternatively, melt it in short bursts in the microwave, stirring between each burst. Set the chocolate aside to cool a little while you separate the eggs. Whisk the egg whites and a pinch of salt using electric beaters until they form soft peaks, then gradually add 200g of sugar, continuing to whisk until the egg whites form stiff peaks. Line a 24cm springform tin with baking parchment. Heat the oven to 170 C/150 fan/gas 3. Using electric beaters, beat the butter and remaining sugar in a large bowl until light and creamy and the sugar has dissolved. Gradually beat in the egg yolks and cooled chocolate. Fold about ⅓ the whisked egg whites into the chocolate mixture. Sift the flour over the mixture in two batches and fold each in. Gently fold in the remaining beaten egg whites using a spatula. Pour the cake batter into the prepared tin, spread evenly and bake for about 1 hr or until the cake is risen and springy to the touch. Put on a wire rack and leave to cool completely in the tin. Heat the jam and liqueur (or juice) in a small saucepan, then pour into a bowl through a fine sieve. Loosen the bottom of the cake tin, then slide off the tin and peel away the baking parchment. Halve the base horizontally. Place the bottom layer on a cake stand and spread with half of the jam mixture, then place the other half of the cake on top. Spread a thin layer of the remaining jam all over the cake and leave to dry. For the chocolate glaze, bring 40ml water and sugar to the boil in a small saucepan until the sugar has dissolved. Leave to cool slightly, then stir in 2 tbsp of the double cream. Heat the remaining cream in a separate pan and stir in the butter until melted. Remove from the heat and gradually add the chocolate, letting it melt into the cream, and stir in the sugar syrup. Place the cake on a cooling rack over a tray to catch any excess glaze. Evenly coat the cake with the glaze by pouring it slowly into the middle, tilting the cake gently so it flows slowly over the edges. Don’t smooth it with a knife or it will look streaky. Best enjoyed fresh but will keep for up to three days. For the striped pattern, melt the milk chocolate either in a microwave or in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, ensuring the bowl isn’t touching the water. Pour the melted chocolate into a small piping bag and pipe onto the still-damp icing in parallel strips, 2-3cm apart. Carefully pull the tip of a spoon alternately from top to bottom through the lines to make the pattern, then allow the glaze to dry.",

    "steps": "Put the dried fruit in a small bowl and pour in just enough brandy or juice to cover. Microwave for 2 mins until steaming, then set aside. The non-messy way to chop chocolate is to smash it (still wrapped) onto your work surface, then unwrap it down to the foil and snap it (still in foil) into small bits using your fingers. Empty the chocolate into a microwaveable bowl. Add the butter and golden syrup, cover the bowl with cling film and microwave for 2 mins until melted. Set aside. Meanwhile, line a 20cm square tin with baking parchment, using a little butter to stick it in place. (You can also use foil but it’s more fiddly to peel off later, or cling film if you don’t mind wrinkles on the underside of your cake.) Take a third, large bowl. Use your fingers to break the biscuits into it. Stir in the nuts, soaked fruit and soaking liquid, then mix everything together. Pour the melted chocolate into the bowl with the biscuits, using a spatula or spoon to scrape out every last bit of chocolate. Mix together until everything is coated in chocolate. Check the ingredients list to make sure everything is accounted for (it’s surprisingly easy to miss something in this recipe), then tip the chocolate mixture into the tin, pushing well into corners and flattening the top. Put in the fridge (no need to cover) for 4 hrs or overnight until set. To serve, remove from tin, peel away the parchment and cut into 16 squares (any crumbly bits that fall off make tasty samples for the cook). Will keep for up to 1 week in an airtight container in the fridge. Can be frozen for up to 1 month.",

Put the butter and chocolate in a large heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, stirring occasionally. Put all the other ingredients in a large mixing bowl and, when the chocolate and butter have melted, pour over and mix with an electric whisk until smooth and well combined. Set aside and rinse the beaters. In another large bowl, add all the sesame cake ingredients, then combine with an electric whisk until smooth. Alternating with dollops of each mixture, divide between the two tins. Level the top, then swirl a skewer through the mixture to create a marbled effect. Bake in the middle of the oven for 45-50 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave the cakes to cool completely on a wire rack while you make the topping (there’s enough for both cakes but the topping recipe is easily halved if you want to freeze one and ice it later) Heat the double cream and butter together gently in a small pan until just simmering, then remove from the heat and add the chocolate. Stir until the mixture is smooth, then place in the fridge for 20 mins to firm up. Beat well with a wooden spoon, then transfer to a disposable piping bag. Snip the end off to make a wide opening, then pipe thick, overlapping zigzags across the cakes. Cut the sesame snaps into shards and arrange on top, scattering over any crumbs, then serve.",

    ],
    "steps": "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease and line two 20cm cake tins with baking parchment – if your cake tins are quite shallow, line the sides to a depth of at least 5cm. Put the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, sugar and 1 tsp salt in a bowl and mix well. If there are any lumps in the sugar, squeeze these through your fingers to break them up. Measure the buttermilk, coffee, oil and vanilla in a jug. Add the egg and whisk until smooth. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk until well combined. Pour the cake mixture evenly into the two tins, and bake for 25-30 mins until risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack, peel off the baking parchment and leave to cool. These sponges can be made up to three days ahead and will stay moist if wrapped in cling film, or you can wrap well and freeze for up to two months. To make the mousse, put the gelatine leaves in a bowl of cold water, one at a time, so they don’t stick together. Set aside for 5 mins to soften. Scoop the pulp and seeds from the passion fruit into a sieve suspended over a bowl, and push through the juice – you should have about 100ml. Put 1 tbsp of the seeds in a small bowl and set aside. Save 2 small empty passion fruit halves and discard the rest. Pour the coconut cream, passion fruit juice and sugar into a saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer. Remove from the heat and stir in the coconut rum liqueur. Add the gelatine to the hot liquid, a leaf at a time, squeezing out the water before you add them. Stir until the gelatine has dissolved. Fill each reserved passion fruit half with some of the mixture, place in a small dish and chill until needed. Leave the remaining mixture to cool to room temperature. Pour the double cream into a large bowl and whip until it’s holding its shape. Add half the passion fruit mixture, fold together, then add the remaining mixture and fold through again. Line a deep 20cm cake tin with a double layer of cling film. Slice each sponge in half through the middle and drizzle each layer with 1 tbsp coconut rum liqueur. Place one of the layers into the tin, flat-side down, and spread with a third of the passion fruit mousse – don’t worry if a little trickles down the sides. Layer the remaining sponges and mousse on top, finishing with a layer of cake. Cover the top of the cake with cling film and chill for at least 4 hrs, or preferably overnight. When the cake has chilled and the mousse is set, turn out onto a cake stand, so the base now becomes the top, and remove the cling film. Using a palette knife, scrape any passion fruit mousse off the edges of the cake, to give it a smooth surface. Place the cake back in the fridge while you prepare the ganache. Put the chocolate and cream in a pan and gently heat, stirring now and then, to make a runny chocolate sauce. Leave to firm up at room temperature until it reaches a spreadable consistency. Remove the cake from the fridge. Spread the ganache over the top and sides of the cake with a palette knife until completely covered. Decorate with a ring of toasted coconut shavings, if you like. Remove the filled passion fruit shells from the fridge and place these on top too, topped with the reserved passion fruit seeds. Chill until ready to serve, but bring out of the fridge 1 hr before slicing (don’t forget to serve the passion fruit jellies to your favourite guests too). Leftovers will keep in the fridge for 2 days.",

    "steps": "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter and line the base of 2 x 20cm cake tins with baking parchment. Beat the butter and light brown sugar together until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs gradually, beating well between each addition. Fold in the flour, baking powder and cocoa powder. If the mixture is very stiff, stir in the milk. Spoon into the cake tins and bake for 20-25 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Turn the cakes out onto a wire rack and peel off the parchment. Gently heat the lime juice and caster sugar together, stirring to help the sugar dissolve. While the cakes and the syrup are still warm, pierce the cakes all over using a skewer and spoon over the syrup. Leave to cool completely. Next, make the candied lime zest. Pare the zest from the limes, cutting it into broad strips. Cut away the white pith and discard, then slice the zest into matchstick sized strips. Put them in a pan and cover with water, then bring to the boil. Cook for 1 min, then drain and rinse. Dry and set aside. Juice the limes and add enough water to make 225ml. Heat gently with the sugar until the sugar has melted. Add the strips of zest and simmer until the liquid has almost evaporated and turned syrupy – about 30 mins. Scoop the strips of zest out with a slotted spoon, then place them on parchment to dry. To make the buttercream, beat the butter and icing sugar together using an electric mixer or by hand (start off gently or the icing sugar will fly everywhere), until pale and light, but don’t beat for so long that it gets too fluffy. Add the lime zest and beat again until smooth. Chill in the fridge until the buttercream is firm, but spreadable. To make the icing, heat the cream gently (don't let it boil), then take it off the heat. Add the chocolate and let it melt, stirring to help it along. Put the marmalade in a small pan with the extra 1 tbsp cream and heat slowly to dissolve. Add to the chocolate and cream and stir until everything is blended. Leave to cool a little, but not so long that it becomes firm. Pour over one of the layers of sponge and leave to cool and set – it will run down the sides and drip off. Spread the buttercream over the other layer, then put the chocolate coated layer on top. Decorate with the candied lime zest.",

Carefully pour the custard into the tart case, grate some more nutmeg over the top and bake for 40 mins or until just set with the very slightest wobble in the middle. Remove from the oven, trim the pastry edges off (away from the filling), then leave to cool completely before serving in slices with a grating more of nutmeg, if you like.",

Chill for 20-30 mins until firm, then use it to line a 23cm tart tin. Push the pastry into the corners, then trim the edge so there’s 1-2cm pastry overhanging the rim (don’t worry if it breaks slightly, as it can be patched with any off-cuts). Prick the pastry base several times with a fork, then chill for 45 mins. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line the chilled pastry case with a sheet of baking parchment, then fill to the top with baking beans, uncooked rice or lentils. Bake for 15 mins, then remove the beans and parchment and bake for 10-15 mins more until the pastry is golden brown. Leave to cool in the tin, then trim the excess pastry using a small serrated knife. Meanwhile, make the custard. Bring the milk and vanilla to the boil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Beat the egg yolks, caster sugar and custard powder together in a medium bowl until well combined. Slowly pour the hot milk mixture over the egg mixture, whisking continuously until everything is smooth and well combined. Tip the custard mixture back into the pan and cook over a medium-low heat, stirring continuously, for 2-3 mins until very thick. Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly. Spread the jam over the base of the cooled pastry case. Carefully pour over the custard and smooth with the back of a spoon or spatula. Sprinkle over the coconut and dot the maraschino cherries around the edge in a circle. Chill for 2-3 hrs, or until set.",

Press the cut circles into the holes of the tin, making sure they come right up and slightly over the top – pushing out any creases. Chill the pastry in the fridge for 20mins.

      "600ml double cream, ¼ tsp vanilla extract",
      "8 egg yolks",
      "100g caster sugar"
    ],
    "steps": "First, make the pastry. Melt the butter in a saucepan until foaming, then sizzle until it turns nut-brown. Pour off the fat into a bowl, leaving the sediment in the pan to be discarded. Leave the fat to cool, then chill until it hardens again. Combine the flour, icing sugar and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl. When the fat has hardened, cut it into chunks and rub it into the flour mixture until crumbly. Stir in the egg yolk and 1 tsp cold water, and bring it together into a dough. Flatten into a disc, then cover and chill for at least 30 mins. Can be made up to two days ahead. (The pastry can also be made with regular butter.) Roll the chilled pastry out on a lightly floured surface to a roughly 5mm thickness, then lift into a 20cm tart tin. Press the pastry into the base and up the side using a small piece of excess floured pastry. Leave some overhanging the rim. Chill for at least 30 mins, or freeze for 10 mins. Reserve any excess pastry. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line the pastry case with baking parchment and fill with baking beans or uncooked rice. Put on a baking tray and bake for 15 mins. Remove the parchment and beans and bake for 15-20 mins more until biscuity. Meanwhile, make the filling. Tip the cream and vanilla into a saucepan and bring to the boil. Stir (don’t whisk) the egg yolks and sugar together in a heatproof bowl. Slowly drizzle the hot cream over the egg yolk mixture, stirring continuously (not whisking) until everything is incorporated. Sieve the custard through a fine mesh sieve into a jug, then spoon off any froth. Remove the baked tart case from the oven, and reduce the temperature to 140C/120C fan/gas 1. Trim the excess pastry from the case, and mend any cracks with the reserved raw pastry. With the tart case on the baking tray, slide it halfway back into the oven, then carefully pour in the filling to the top of the case. Finely grate over at least half a nutmeg. Gently slide the tray fully into the oven and bake for 40 mins, or until just set with a very slight wobble. Leave to cool completely in the tin, then remove from the case and cut into slices.",

Bake for 20 mins or until the squash is still slightly resistant to a sharp knife, but not hard. Don’t overcook the squash, or it will break when you try to move it. Meanwhile, scatter the rest of the sugar into an ovenproof frying pan about 20cm across, and heat it gently until it melts and starts to caramelise. Tip the pan if you need to combine patches of sugar that haven’t melted into the liquid parts, but don’t be tempted to stir. When you have a medium amber-coloured caramel, sprinkle on the spices and lemon juice. Turn the heat off. Take the squash out of the oven and leave to cool for a couple of mins. Use tongs to place the squash in the frying pan, gently arranging the slices in a tight spiral on the caramel. Start with a large slice in the centre and lay the other slices on top so it looks neat when you turn it out. When the squash is all in the pan, turn the heat on again and cook until the caramel starts to bubble. Turn the heat down and cook for about 10-15 mins, making sure the caramel doesn’t burn. You want the squash to give off any water and then to start absorbing the caramel – the caramel will start to get very liquid as this happens, so turn the heat up at the end and make sure the caramel thickens up completely. Turn the heat off, drop the butter into the centre of the pan and wait for it to melt. Cut the pastry into a rough circle just bigger than the pan and drape it over the squash, folding any excess over on itself and carefully tucking it in around the edge. Bake for 20 mins, then turn the heat down to 160C/140C fan/gas 3 and bake for a further 20 mins. Turn out onto a plate while the tarte is hot so the squash and caramel release easily. Serve with crème fraîche or ice cream.",

Blitz until smooth. Spread the caramel onto the base of the tart and put in the fridge for 30 mins to set a little. To make the ganache topping, heat the remaining coconut milk over a low heat until steaming. Put the chocolate and coconut oil in a large bowl and pour the warm coconut milk over the top. Leave to sit for a minute, then gently stir until combined. Spoon the mixture over the caramel and spread it out – don’t worry if the caramel comes up the sides a bit. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and leave to set in the fridge for about an hour, then bring to room temperature before slicing and serving.",

Once you have a smooth ball of dough wrap it tightly in cling film and chill in the fridge for 30mins.  Heat oven to 190C/170C/gas 4 and grease a 23cm loose bottomed fluted tart tin. Roll out the chilled pastry on a lightly floured surface and use it to line the tin. Leave about half a cm of pastry proud of the edge of the tin - snipping it to length with kitchen scissors.  Line the base with a piece of baking parchment and weigh it down with baking beans or uncooked rice. Bake for 15 mins then remove the paper and beans and brush the pastry surface with beaten egg white. Return to the oven for a further 15-20 mins or until crisp, golden and cooked through. Leave to cool completely (can be done a day ahead).  Spread half of the caramel on the case of the pastry case and layer the sliced bananas on top. Cover with the rest of the caramel and place in the fridge. Whip the cream until billowy thick and spoon it over the top of the tart. To serve finely grate over a 1-2 pieces of dark chocolate to garnish. ",

      "400g punnet of strawberries, halved "

    "steps": "To make the base, butter and line a 23cm loose-bottomed tin with baking parchment. Put the digestive biscuits in a plastic food bag and crush to crumbs using a rolling pin. Transfer the crumbs to a bowl, then pour over the melted butter. Mix thoroughly until the crumbs are completely coated. Tip them into the prepared tin and press firmly down into the base to create an even layer. Chill in the fridge for 1 hr to set firmly.For more detail on how to make a biscuit base, take a look at our how to make a biscuit base video. Slice the vanilla pod in half lengthways, leaving the tip intact, so that the two halves are still joined. Holding onto the tip of the pod, scrape out the seeds using the back of a kitchen knife. Pour the double cream into a bowl and whisk with an electric mixer until it’s just starting to thicken to soft peaks. Place the soft cheese, icing sugar and the vanilla seeds in a separate bowl, then beat for 2 mins with an electric mixer until smooth and starting to thicken, it will get thin and then start to thicken again. Tip in the double cream and fold it into the soft cheese mix. You’re looking for it to be thickened enough to hold its shape when you tip a spoon of it upside down. If it’s not thick enough, continue to whisk. Spoon onto the biscuit base, starting from the edges and working inwards, making sure that there are no air bubbles. Smooth the top of the cheesecake down with the back of a dessert spoon or spatula. Leave to set in the fridge overnight. Bring the cheesecake to room temperature about 30 mins before serving. To remove it from the tin, place the base on top of a can, then gradually pull the sides of the tin down. Slip the cake onto a serving plate, removing the lining paper and base. Purée half the strawberries in a blender or food processor with the icing sugar and 1 tsp water, then sieve. Pile the remaining strawberries onto the cake, and pour the purée over the top.",

Arrange in a shallow baking dish, about 20 x 26 x 5cm, buttered-side up, in three layers, sprinkling the raisins and finely grating some nutmeg over the bottom two layers and leaving the top layer clear. Pour over the warm custard, lightly pressing the bread down with your fingers to help it soak in. Leave to stand for at least 20 mins before cooking. Can be prepared up to this stage several hours ahead, chilled and cooked when needed. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Sit the dish in a large roasting tin and pour a kettleful of hot water into the roasting tin so it comes three-quarters of the way up the outside of the dish. Bake in the oven for 20-25 mins until the custard is just set. Remove the pudding from its water bath and scatter the top liberally with more sugar. Caramelise the top under a hot grill or with a blowtorch – take it really far (a few burnt edges add to the flavour), but be careful it doesn’t catch. Leave the pudding to rest for 5 mins, then serve with your favourite ice cream – I like bitter orange marmalade ice cream.",

To make the batter, put all the ingredients in a large bowl with 1/4 tsp salt. Use an electric mixer to beat together on a low speed until the batter is smooth and evenly mixed. Pour the batter on top of the bananas and level out with a spatula. Bake in the oven for 55 mins-1 hr or until a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. If the cake begins to look too dark, cover with foil after 45 mins. Allow to cool in the tin for 10 mins before turning out onto a plate. Best served warm but also delicious at room temperature. Best eaten within 2 days.",

Open the pastry out and spoon the fruit filling onto one side, leaving a border of about 1cm around the edge. Brush the beaten egg around the edges and fold the pastry again to encase the filling. Use a fork to seal the edges all the way around, then brush all over with more egg. Poke a few air holes in the top with the fork. Repeat with the remaining pastry and filling.

Transfer the mince to a plate, then fry the onion, carrots and celery in the rest of the oil over a low heat until softened. Stir in the tomato purée and crumble in the stock cube, then return the mince to the pan and give everything a good stir. Fry for a minute, then add 300ml water. Cover with a lid and simmer for 20 mins, then remove the lid and simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly. Stir in the peas, then turn off the heat and leave to cool for 10 mins Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Divide the mince mixture between four individual pie dishes (or use one large dish). Brush the dish rims with egg. Unroll the pastry and cut it into four pieces for the individual pies – roll the pieces out a little more to fit the pie dishes if you need to. Top each pie with some pastry, press down against the rim and trim any excess. Seal the edges with a fork, or crimp if you like, then brush the pastry with egg. Poke a little hole in the top, decorate with any offcuts if you like (brushed with a little egg), then cook for 25-30 mins or until the pastry is golden and risen. Cool for 5-10 minutes before serving.",

    "steps": "Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Peel and chop the onion as finely as possible. Melt the butter in the pan over a medium heat. Add the chopped onion and leave to cook for 5 mins, stirring occasionally. Finely slice the mushrooms and add them to the pan with the onions. When the onions and mushrooms are almost cooked, add the flour to the pan and stir to make a thick paste called a roux. Crumble the stock cube in and stir well. Continuously stir the roux over a low heat for 2 mins to cook out the flour. This stops the sauce from having a starchy taste. Slowly add the warm milk to the pan, stirring all the time. Once all the milk has been added, season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and mustard powder. Add the bay leaf and bring to the boil, stirring all the time to stop the sauce becoming lumpy. When the sauce has thickened, add more milk or water as necessary to get the desired consistency, bring to the boil, then turn down to a very low heat. Chop the cooked chicken into even sized pieces and add to the sauce. Add your veg and pour into the pie dish. Put the pastry on a clean, floured surface. Make sure you also dust the rolling pin with flour. Roll out the pastry, trying not to make any tears. Measure the pastry against the pie dish and once the pastry is slightly larger than the top, lift it carefully over the dish. It might be helpful to use the rolling pin to help you move the pastry. Trim off the pastry hanging over the edge of the dish. Press the outside edge of the pastry with a fork or your fingers to make a nice pattern. Brush the top of the pie with beaten egg or milk. Make a small hole in the centre of the pastry top to allow the steam to escape. You can use any leftover pastry to decorate the top of the pie with pastry shapes if you like. Place the pie in the oven for 25 mins. It is ready when golden brown.",

Off the heat, add the milk, yogurt and vanilla, followed by the eggs. Beat well with a fork. Put the dry ingredients plus ¼ tsp salt into a large bowl. Whisk to combine – this aerates and saves sifting. Tip in the wet ingredients and whisk to a smooth, silky batter. Don’t hang around at this point. Pour the batter evenly into the prepared tins and put onto the middle shelf in the oven. Bake for 25 mins or until risen and a skewer inserted into the middle of the cakes comes out clean. Cool for 10 mins in the tins, then carefully invert the cakes and leave to cool upside down on a cooling rack.  Make the buttercream. Stir the cocoa into 2 tbsp milk until smooth. Put the butter into a large bowl and sift the icing sugar on top. Add the cocoa mixture, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Beat for a few mins with electric beaters until creamy and spreadable. Add the extra 1 tsp milk if you need to. Place one of the cakes towards the back of the board or plate, and fix it with a little of the buttercream to stop it slipping about. Spread with ¼ of the buttercream. Sandwich the second cake on top. With a small, serrated knife, cut away a scallop-shaped crater from the top cake. Cut about half way down into the sponge and removing about a quarter of the top of the cake. Keep the piece you remove. Position two diggers on the top of the cake to see if your crater is about the right size and shape, then set them aside again. Using a palette knife, paddle the rest of the buttercream evenly over the top of the cake and down its sides. Make sure that the edge of the excavated area is defined. Snap the ends from enough of the KitKat fingers to follow the edge of the excavated area, then press them into the buttercream. Now fix the rest of the whole fingers around the side of the cake. Crumble the cake that you removed in step 6, to make soil. Part-fill the excavated hole with the soil, adding a few Smarties, if you like. Position the diggers on top and put some soil and Smarties into their buckets. Fill a lorry or dump truck with more crumbs and Smarties, and let some of the soil and spill over the edge of the cake and the broken KitKats. Use the marker to write your message on the card and draw some diagonal black lines. Cut the straight part of the straw into two equal pieces, then fix these to the back of the card with tape to make a sign. Position the sign at the back of the cake. If the sponges are used fresh or within a day of baking (wrap well once cooled), the finished cake will keep in a cool place (not the fridge) for 2 days.",

    ],
    "steps": "Heat the oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Grease and line a 30x20cm cake tin with baking parchment. Put the butter and 200g of the chocolate into a saucepan and heat gently until melted. Remove from the heat. Sieve the flour, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda into a large bowl. Mix in the sugar. Beat together the eggs, soured cream and vanilla extract. Pour the chocolate and egg mixtures into the flour and sugar and beat well until smooth. Pour into the prepared tin and bake in the oven for about 40 minutes. Leave until completely cold before cutting and shaping. Cut the cake in half lengthways. Place one complete half on the 30cm cake board. Cut the remaining half into 3 rectangles, 13x10cm, 7x10cm and 10x10cm. Attach the 10x10cm piece to one end of the base cake using a little warm jam. Cut a ‘V’ shape to represent the prow of the ship. Place the 13x10 piece at the other end of the base cake, attaching with jam. Using jam again attach the 7x10 piece on top of the 13x10 piece to make the upper deck. Slice the back of the ship at a very slight angle. Brush the whole cake with jam. Roll out about 550g of the ready-to-roll icing and cover the cake. Trim the edges at the base and keep any trimmings. Melt the remaining 100g chocolate in the microwave or in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Use melted chocolate to stick the mini Toblerones to the edges of the two decks and to the ‘V’ shape of the prow. Trim any to fit exactly. Use the chocolate to stick on the chocolate balls for canon balls, finger biscuits stacked up as canons and chocolate caramels for port holes. Using a little of the marzipan, roll out and cut four windows. Make window frames from brown icing trimmings, rolling out to thin sausages to form a cross and sticking with chocolate. Attach to the sides of the ship with chocolate. Poke the chocolate stick out of the front of the prow, if using. Arrange the chocolate coins in a little pile on the cake board, reserving 3 or 4 coins for the top. Roll out the remaining brown icing and cover the coins completely. Brush with melted chocolate and sprinkle with muscovado sugar. Push 3 or 4 coins into the sand along with the chocolate skull if using. Put a little of the royal icing in a bowl. Colour the remainder blue. Spread the icing on the cake board around the ship and the island. Use the white icing to make ‘surf’ around the edge of the island. Using the remaining marzipan and brown icing, make three barrels. Place one on the deck of the ship and the others in the sea. Cut out sails from the paper and make holes in them so you can push the straws through. Attach the sails to the ship and poke sandwich flags out of the top to finish.",

    "steps": "Heat the oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Grease and line a deep 15cm round cake tin, making sure the lining is higher than the top of the tin. Grease and base line a 1 litre ovenproof glass pudding basin. Using electric beaters or a tabletop mixer, beat the butter, sugar, vanilla and ¼ tsp salt together until pale and fluffy, then pour in the eggs, one at a time, giving the mix a really good beating before adding the next. Add 1 tbsp of the plain flour if the mix starts to look slimy rather than fluffy. Beat in the yogurt. Mix the flours; then, using a large metal spoon, fold them into the batter, and spoon into the prepared tin and bowl. The mixture will come almost to the top. Place the bowl and cake tin on a baking tray. Cook in the oven for about 1 hour 40 to 1hour 50 mins. Allow the cakes to cool completely. To make the butter icing, put the butter into a bowl and beat well until softened. Gradually beat in the icing sugar. Trim the tops of the cakes level. Slice the pudding basin cake in three and the 15cm cake in half. Using a 5cm round cutter, stamp out the centre of each piece of cake. Place one half of the 15cm cake on a cake board. Spread with a little butter icing and place the other half on top. Spread a little icing on this layer and top with the widest layer of the basin cake. Repeat with the other layers. Spread the remaining butter icing all over the assembled cake. Take 250g white fondant icing and roll out into a long strip about 7cm wide. Press the edge gently with a teaspoon to give a frilled effect or use a ball tool. Attach to the base of the cake, pushing gently onto the icing. Roll out the pink icing to a large circle about 36cm in diameter. Cut a hole from the centre using the 5cm cutter. Cut away just under an eighth section of the icing. Drape the icing over the cake, making the join at the back. At even intervals push up the pink fondant to create a swagged look. Spray the cake lightly with the edible lustre. Take the doll and wrap the legs in plastic film. Place the doll in the cake. The top of the cake should come to hip not waist level. Using the trimmings, roll out an oblong of pink icing and wrap around the body of the doll to make the bodice. Smooth the bottom of the bodice onto the top of the skirt. Roll out some white fondant and cut out a 9cm circle using a fluted or flower cutter. Cut a small circle from the centre of this and then split one side and place around the waist of the doll, cutting away any excess. Use the remaining white icing to make a large bow and place at the back of the dolls waist. Make up the royal icing according to pack instructions. Using a piping bag fitted with a small plain nozzle (or use a strong plastic bag and cut off the tip), pipe around the edge of the pink skirt. Attach a rose to the top of each swag. Pipe three lines of dots just above the roses going up the dress. Pipe across the top of the bodice and half way down the front. Using the icing attach a sugar butterfly to the top of the bodice and one large sugar rose at the waist.",

Bake in the oven for about 45 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Cool. When cold, slice the top off the cake to make it level. To make the mint cake, grease and base line your 20cm cake tin with baking parchment. Put the butter into a bowl and beat until soft. Add the remaining ingredients and beat well until light and creamy. Spoon into the tin and spread level. Bake in the oven for about 45 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Cool. Do not slice the top level as it needs to be rounded. To make the butter icing, put the butter into a bowl and beat until soft. Gradually beat in the icing sugar. Slice the chocolate and mint cakes in half horizontally so you have four layers. Using an 8cm round cutter, stamp a circle from the centre of each layer. Place the bottom layer of chocolate cake on a 25cm cake board. Spread with a little butter icing. Place the bottom green layer on top. Spread with butter icing and place the other chocolate layer on top. Spread with more icing and place the rounded green sponge on top. Fill the centre hole with sweets, almost to the top. Take one of the 8cm green sponge pieces and slice in half horizontally. Place one piece on the cake to cover the hole containing the sweets. Spread the top with the remaining butter icing. Roll out about 300g of the white fondant icing to a 20cm circle and place on top of the cake. Brush the sides of the cake with apricot jam. Measure the circumference of the cake and the depth. Add 2.5cm to the depth measurement. Using these measurements roll out the green fondant to a long strip. (You may find it easier to do two shorter strips). Attach the strip around the cake. Use scissors snip around the top edge to represent grass. Make a cardboard template of a pentagon (5 sides). Roll out the black icing and cut out six pentagons. Place them on the cake as for a football. If you wish to stick them in place use a little icing sugar mixed with water. With the remaining white icing trimmings make a scarf and paint with food colouring in your team colours. Drape the scarf over the edge of the cake. Add candles as desired.",

Remove and allow to become completely cold before cutting and icing. To make the butter icing, put the butter into a bowl and beat well. Gradually beat in the icing sugar until smooth and creamy. Cut the cake in half to make two rectangles each 10x20cm. Take one half and cut into two pieces measuring 10x14cm and 10x6cm. Using a little butter icing, attach the 10x6cm piece to one end of the 10x20cm piece. This is the cab part of the engine. Take the 10x14cm piece and slice in half horizontally. Spread a little butter icing on the main part of the fire engine (behind the cab) and stick on one of the 10x14cm pieces. The remaining piece of cake is not required. Using a sharp knife, slice the front of the cab at an angle where the windows will be placed. Spread the whole cake with butter icing. Roll out the red fondant and use to cover the fire engine. Trim around the base. Roll out all but 50g of the grey icing to an irregular strip and place on a 30cm cake board. Carefully lift the fire engine onto the board. Unroll about half the liquorice from each of the four wheels. Attach the strips, using a little of the red icing, to make a double border around the base of the cake. Again using the icing, attach the four wheels. Use leftover liquorice to make strips to mark the centre of the road. Roll out the reserved grey icing and cut out 6 shutters and two wing mirrors. Attach to the cake using red icing. Use the white icing to make two front and two side windows for the cab. Attach with red royal icing and pipe around each window and pipe the cab doors. Stick on dolly mixtures to represent headlights, roof lights and ladder supports. Make a ladder from the chocolate covered biscuit or mint sticks, chopping and sticking with icing. Attach to the top of the engine with icing. Stick together the two party rings and attach to the side of the fire engine. Roll the yellow fondant icing into a long sausage and wrap around the biscuits to represent the hose, snake out onto the board and then make a small circle of yellow icing and stick on the end for the nozzle. Colour the remaining royal icing a pale blue colour. Thin with a little water if necessary and drizzle onto the cake board to represent water flowing from the hose. Using a little blue colouring thinned with water, paint the windows with a fine paint brush. Using black colouring, paint windscreen wipers on the front windows.",

Half fill the muffin cases and then fill the two cake tins 3/4 full. Bake in the oven placing the cake tins on one shelf and the muffin tin on another. Open the oven door and remove the muffins and smaller cake quickly when they are done as you don't want to let the heat out of the oven. The muffins will take about 35 mins, the 13cm cake about 1 hour 10 mins and the 18cm cake about 1 1/2 hours. You know each is done when a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Allow the cakes to become completely cold before icing. Trim the tops of the two cakes so they are flat. Slice each one in half, spread with jam and then sandwich together again. Using a 6cm cutter, cut each muffin to make a cylinder. Trim the tops flat. Sandwich together with jam to make a tower. To make the butter icing put the butter into a bowl and beat until soft. Gradually beat in the icing sugar. Spread the butter icing over both cakes and the muffin tower. Roll out the white icing and use to cover the two cakes. Place the larger one on a cake board. Put the smaller one on top. Roll a strip of white icing and wrap around the muffin tower. Place on top of the cake. Push a wooden skewer though the cakes to hold them together. Using about 150g pink icing, mould into an onion shape for the dome. Put to one side. Roll out a little pink icing and cut out a 6cm round and place on top of the muffin tower. Using the made up royal icing, attach the dome to the top of the tower. Using the pink icing make two doors and two curtains. Attach to the cake using royal icing. Make windows by rolling out the lilac icing and cutting out hearts using medium, small and tiny cutters. Attach these upside down to the cake with royal icing. Roll a small piece of lilac icing into a thin sausage and stick around the curtains to make the window frame. Again using the royal icing, stick on the pieces of gum around the doors, and the sugar cubes around the edge of the cakes. Attach silver balls to the dome to decorate and to the doors to make handles. Score horizontal lines down the doors to give a textured effect. Attach a piece of gum under each window on the middle tier and then stick three flowers on top to make window boxes. Colour the remaining royal icing green and spoon into a piping bag fitted with a plain nozzle. Pipe creeper branches up the castle walls. Attach mini sugar flowers.

Put the butter, 300g of the sugar, eggs, flour and milk into a large bowl and beat well until light and creamy. Spread just under half the mixture in the cake tin. Take just under half of the remaining mixture and put into a bowl and colour deep red with food colouring. Put 3–4 small spoonfuls of red cake mix onto the mixture in the cake tin. Using the handle of a teaspoon pull the red mix through to give a marbled effect. Using the remaining plain and red cake mix place spoonfuls in a random fashion in the two prepared bowls. Again use the teaspoon handle to give a marbled effect. Bake in the oven for about 30 mins for the small bowl, about 35 mins for the medium and 50–60 mins for the cake tin. The mixture is cooked when firm to the touch and when a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. When the cakes are cold trim off any peaks that have formed. Place the round cake on a large cake board. Cut three small ‘v’ shapes on the edge of the cake, to make an uneven shape for the volcano base. Spread a little apricot glaze all over the cake and place the larger bowl cake, rounded side up, on top. Brush with apricot glaze and place the remaining cake, rounded side up, on top. Cut a small hollow in the top of this cake (to represent the ‘mouth’ of the volcano) and then brush the cake with apricot glaze. Roll out the marzipan to a large circle to cover the cake. It can be quite a rough shape. Lift it onto the cake and drape in a random fashion in the nooks and crannies to make a volcano shape. Melt the chocolate in a microwave or in a bowl over a pan of hot water. Using a pastry brush, paint the volcano with chocolate. Attach chunks of chocolate, popcorn etc with melted chocolate. Add the dinosaurs. Drizzle any remaining chocolate over the volcano in a random fashion. To make the lava put the remaining 50g sugar into a small non-stick frying pan. Heat gently without stirring until the sugar has melted but is still clear. Lightly oil a metal baking sheet. When the sugar is just turning light brown at the edge, remove from the heat and carefully stir in a little red paste food colouring. Using a teaspoon, drizzle lava shapes onto the prepared tray. Leave to cool completely. When cold, carefully lift the lava shapes and place in the top of the volcano. For extra effect use birthday candles, cake sparklers, or cake fountains.",

    "steps": "Make the 15cm fruit cake. You can do this up to a month in advance and wrap it in cling film. Once a week you can feed it with a little dark rum or brandy by poking holes in the top and spooning a little into the holes. Marzipan the fruitcake. Heat the apricot jam until bubbling, then take off the heat. Sieve if necessary to remove any bits. Level off the top of the fruit cake using a long serrated bread knife. Brush the top with jam and flip the cake over and position it on top of the 15cm cake board. Briefly knead the marzipan and smooth into a ball. Dust the work surface with icing sugar. Roll out into a circle. Use a bit of string or tape measure to measure your fruit cake’s top and sides so you know how far to roll out the dough. Brush the cake with apricot jam and then carefully transfer the marzipan to the cake (see picture 1). Gently smooth the top first, then ease your hands down the sides, carefully lifting and coaxing the marzipan so that it fits without overlapping (see picture 2). When you have reached the bottom edges of the cake, use a sharp knife to shave off any excess marzipan. You can do this up to a month in advance. Ice the cake drum (see picture 4). Lightly knead 500g icing and form into a ball. Dust your work surface with sifted icing sugar and roll out the icing in a circle using a tape measure to check that it is wide enough (23cm). Brush the drum with cooled boiled water and transfer the icing to the board. Gently roll over the board again, then trim the edges with a small sharp knife. Roll gently again if you like to get a really smooth finish. Watch out for fingerprints and bits of fluff as ready-to-roll icing can be quite delicate.You can do this in advance too. If you do, put it in a cake box to stop it gathering dust. Make the 23cm lemon cake. The unfilled cake will keep well if you wrap it with baking parchment and cling film for up to 4 days, or in the freezer for up to a month. Buttercream the zingy lemon cake. Make buttercream by beating together the butter, icing sugar and lemon zest. You can do this the day before icing. Level off the top of the lemon cake using a long serrated bread knife. Spread a little of the buttercream onto the 23cm cake board. Turn cake upside down onto the board. Brush all over with a thin layer of the sieved apricot jam - this helps to stop crumbs getting into the buttercream. Cut the cake in half horizontally using the bread knife. It doesn’t matter if it’s not perfect as people won’t be able to see once the cake is covered. Use a palette knife to spread a layer of buttercream onto the top of the cut side of the cake on the board. Put the top layer back on and press down a little to level it. Spread the remaining buttercream on the top and sides of the cake using the palette knife to smooth the surface (see picture 3). Pop the cake in the fridge until the buttercream is firm, this will make it easier to ice. To cover the cakes in the icing, you’ll need 500g for the smaller cake and 900g for the larger one. For each, gently work the icing into a ball. Dust the work surface with icing sugar and roll it into a circle. Again use a tape measure or piece of string to ensure the circle is big enough to cover the cake. In the case of the fruitcake, brush the marzipan with cooled boiled water, then transfer the icing onto the cake and smooth it down in the same way as the marzipan. Use a cake smoother if you have one to get a really smooth finish (see picture 5). For the lemon cake, you won’t need any additional gluing, the buttercream will do the job. Once you have smoothed the icing over the cake, trim it carefully. A ribbon will hide the bottom of the cake so it doesn’t need to be perfect. Save any leftover icing to make the decorations. Wrap it in clingfilm and put into a freezer bag to seal out the air. To stack the cakes, use three plastic dowels, these help to keep the cake stable and level. Insert three dowels in a triangle, 2cms in from where the edges of the smaller cake will be (see picture 6). With a pen, mark where the top of the icing comes to on the dowel. Carefully pull out the dowels, you can use tweezers for this, and line them up. Pick the dowel with the highest mark, this is the length you want all the dowels to be. Score the dowels with scissors at this length and cut or snap the plastic. Put the rods back into the three holes, rounded end down. Smooth a little leftover buttercream onto cake where the dowels are. Pick the best side of the smaller cake and aim to position this at the front. Carefully lift it onto the larger one, you can use a palette knife to help you lower the cake. To decorate, pinch off a small ball of icing and leave it white. Divide the remaining icing into quarters. Dye two quarters brown. Do this by dipping a toothpick into the colouring paste and gradually adding more colour to the icing, kneading it as you go (see picture 7). Keep going until you have the colour you want and it is smoothly incorporated with no streaks. It’s better to do this gradually as the colours can be quite strong and it’s easy to add too much. Dye the remaining two balls of icing in your chosen pastels. Wrap all of the balls in clingfilm and pop into a freezer bag until ready to use. This will stop them from becoming crusty. Start by decorating the bottom layer. Roll out the icing, cutting out approximately 12 shapes. We did six brown teddies and alternated them with either a pink duck (three in total) or a blue duck (three in total). Paint a small amount of edible glue onto the back of each teddy and stick it on. Then repeat with the ducks, placing them between the teddies. For the top layer, we cut out 12 small bunnies, alternating brown, blue, pink, brown, blue pink etc. Stick the shapes with even spacing between them on to the cake. The number of shapes you need will depend on the size of the cutters you’ve chosen. To make the teddy, roll out one small ball for the head and one slightly larger one for the body. Stick the head on top of the body. Roll out two sausages of icing one for the legs and one for the arms. Cut them in half. Stick the arms to the side of the body and flatten the ends to form little paws. Next stick on the legs, again flattening the ends to form paws. Roll two small balls of brown, flatten and cup them slightly to make ears. Make a little ball of white icing to stick onto the face to make a muzzle. Dip a toothpick into the brown colouring paste and do two dots for eyes. Roll tiny balls of icing for the nose (in brown) and buttons (in white) and stick them on. If you like, take some white icing and make pads for the feet and for the inner ears too (see picture 9). To make the rabbit, roll a sausage of pink or blue icing and snip the top and the bottom one third along. Form the top into ears and the bottom into legs. Pinch a neck about 1 cm under the ears and then snip each side upwards from the legs to just below the neck to form arms and mould them slightly (see picture 8). Make a face by dipping your toothpick back into the brown paste and draw on eyes, a nose and whiskers. Sit the teddy on top of the cake and arrange the bunny on his lap. If you like and are handy with writing icing, write the child’s name on the second tier or stick a candle there.",

    "steps": "Heat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Use a little of the butter to grease the sides and bases of two 20cm sandwich tins. Melt the rest of the butter in a small saucepan. Off the heat, add the milk, yogurt and vanilla, followed by the eggs. Beat well with a fork. Put the dry ingredients plus ¼ tsp salt into a large bowl. Whisk to combine – this aerates and saves sifting. Tip in the wet ingredients and whisk to a smooth, silky batter. Don’t hang around at this point. Pour the batter evenly into the prepared tins and put onto the middle shelf in the oven. Bake for 25 mins or until risen and a skewer inserted into the middle of the cakes comes out clean. Cool for 10 mins in the tins, then carefully invert the cakes and leave to cool upside down on a cooling rack. Make the buttercream. Put the butter into a large bowl and sift the icing sugar on top. Add the vanilla and milk and a pinch of salt then beat for a few mins with electric beaters until creamy, pale and spreadable. Sandwich the cakes with just under ¼ of the buttercream and then all of the jam, if using. Mark the cake into six then cut out two of the wedges. Chill all of the cake in the fridge for 30 mins to firm up the crumbs, which will make icing easier. While you wait, colour the remaining buttercream with a little green food colouring gel. Split the sugarpaste into four pieces, one 500g, one 250g, one 150g and one 100g. Colour 250g green to make the legs and arms. Colour 150g pink, to make the spines. Position the cakes on the board and, once you’re happy, use a little buttercream to anchor them. The main part of the cake will make the body of the dinosaur and the root of its tail, and the two cutout wedges will make the face. Shape the 500g piece of sugarpaste to make a tail, tapering at the end. Flatten the other end out (the piece will look a bit like a witch’s hat at this point) and mould it over the tail part of the cake. Using a palette knife, spread the coloured buttercream over each piece of cake and the tail. Shape 100g white icing into eyes and teeth and poke them into the buttercream. Shape two small sausages to make an arm, with two claws, and position on the cake. Shape the rest of the green sugarpaste into two legs, adding claws if you like. Press them into the buttercream on the dinosaur’s belly. Shape the pink icing into spikes and position them along the spine and under the tail. Use two small sausages of pink icing for the eyelids if you like. Finally press the Smarties all over the dinosaur, saving two for the eyes. Leave to set. If you want to cover the board, rub a few drops of blue colouring into the coconut until even. Mix the royal icing sugar with 2 tbsp water, then brush this all over the board and around the dinosaur. Sprinkle with the coconut and the chocolate sprinkles and leave to set. If the sponges are used fresh or within a day of baking (wrap well once cooled), the finished cake will keep in a cool place (not the fridge) for 3 days.",

Pour in the milk, egg and vanilla, and bring everything together with your hands into a rough dough, making sure all the flour is mixed in. Or, do this using a stand mixer. Cover with a clean, damp cloth and set aside for 30 mins. Tip the dough onto a clean surface and knead for 10-15 mins by hand or 5-8 mins in a stand mixer on low speed until springy and glossy. Use your hands to work the softened butter into the dough – this will take about 5 mins. At first, it will look like it’s not coming together, but keep working the dough through your fingers and it will become smooth and glossy. Form the dough into a ball and return it to the bowl. Cover and leave in a warm place to prove for 2-3 hrs, or until nearly doubled in size. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to a 2cm thickness, then use a 9cm cutter to stamp out as many circles as you can. Use a 4cm cutter to stamp out the middles. Re-roll the trimmings (including the middles) and stamp out more (you should end up with six ring doughnuts). Re-roll any remaining trimmings and use the 4cm cutter to stamp out five or six mini bites. Put the doughnuts and bites on the prepared tray, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for another 2-3 hrs, or in the fridge overnight until doubled in size. The lightness of the doughnuts depends on thissecond proving, and a longer prove in the fridge will give the doughnuts more flavour. Fill a deep-fat fryer following manufacturer’s instructions, or a heavy-based pan, ensuring it is no more than a third full. Heat to 170C or until a cube of bread dropped in browns in 30 seconds. Carefully lift two or three doughnuts from the tray and slide them into the hot oil using a floured spatula. Fry for 2 mins each side until puffed up and golden brown, then remove to a sheet of kitchen paper using a slotted spoon or tongs. Leave to cool. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts, then fry all the mini bites for a total of 2 mins. When the doughnuts and bites have cooled, you can either coat them in sugar or a glaze. For sugar doughnuts, combine the sugar and cinnamon, then toss with the doughnuts. For glazed doughnuts, sift the icing sugar into a bowl and mix in 2 tbsp cold water until you have a runny icing. Dip in the doughnuts, then decorate with the toppings of your choice. Best eaten straightaway, but will keep in an airtight container for a day.",

Tip the pastry onto the work surface and knead very briefly into a smooth ball, adding up to 3 tbsp cold water if it’s too dry. Squash the pastry into a disc. Wrap and chill while you make the filling. Heat the oil in a frying pan and cook the onions and thyme leaves for 8-10 mins until the onions have softened and started to caramelise. Tip into a bowl and leave to cool. Once cool, mix in the grated cheese, mustard and spring onions. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and line a baking tray with baking parchment. Roll the chilled pastry out on a lightly floured surface to the thickness of a £1 coin. Cut out as many 10-12cm circles as you can (you can use a cup or mug as a template), then re-roll any off-cuts and repeat. You should get about 10-12 circles in total. Spoon a mound of the filling into the centre of each pastry circle, leaving the edges clear. Working with one circle at a time, brush a little of the remaining beaten egg around the edge, then bring two sides up to meet in the middle in a half-moon shape. Pinch the pastry together, crimping the edge to seal. Transfer to the baking tray and repeat with the remaining pastry circles and filling. Brush all the pasties with some beaten egg. Will keep frozen for two months. Bake the pasties for 20-25 mins (or 40-45 mins from frozen) until the pastry is deep golden brown. Leave to cool for at least 10 mins before eating warm, or cool completely and pack into containers for a picnic. Will keep in an airtight container for up to three days.",

The icing will be very runny but will thicken a little as it cools. (If the icing has set too much before the cake has cooled, reheat it slightly to make it easier to pour.)

    "ingredients": [
      "400g malted grain brown bread flour, or wholemeal or granary bread flour",
      "100g strong white bread flour",
      "7g sachet easy-bake dried yeast (or 2 tsp Quick dried yeast)",
      "1½ tsp salt",
      "1 tbsp soft butter",
      "1 large onion, cut into thin wedges",
      "1 tbsp olive oil",
      "1 beaten egg"
    ],
    "steps": "Mix your choice of brown flour with the white, the yeast and salt in a large mixing bowl. Put in the butter and rub it into the flour. Stir in the seeds if using. Make a dip in the centre of the flour and pour in almost 300ml hand warm (cool rather than hot) water, with a round-bladed knife. Then mix in enough of the remaining water and a bit more if needed, to gather up any dry bits in the bottom of the bowl and until the mixture comes together as a soft, not too sticky, dough. Gather it into a ball with your hands. Put the dough on to a very lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 mins until it feels smooth and elastic, only adding the minimum of extra flour if necessary to prevent the dough sticking. Place the ball of dough on a lightly floured work surface. Cover with an upturned, clean, large glass bowl and leave for 45 mins-1 hr or until doubled in size and feels light and springy. Timing will depend on the warmth of the room. Knock back the dough by lightly kneading just 3-4 times. You only want to knock out any large air bubbles, so too much handling now will lose the dough’s lightness. Shape into a ball. Cover with the glass bowl and leave for 15 mins. Fry the onion in the olive oil until very lightly caramelised, then leave to cool. Cut the dough in half and shape into 2 balls. Cover with the glass bowl and leave for 15 mins. Shape by flattening each ball into an 18cm round, put each on a large baking tray lined with baking parchment. Make 6 deepish cuts with a sharp knife to mark each round into 6 wedges. Cover with a clean tea towel. Leave for 40-45 mins, or until doubled in size. Finish by brushing with beaten egg, scatter over the onion, then the grated cheese. Put a roasting tin in the bottom of the oven 20 mins before ready to bake and heat oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. Put the risen bread in the oven, carefully pour about 250ml cold water into the roasting tin (this will hiss and create a burst of steam to give you a crisp crust), then lower the heat to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Bake for 30-35 mins or until golden. If the onion is getting too brown, lay a piece of parchment over the top. Remove and cool on a wire rack. If you tap the underneath of the loaf if should be firm and sound hollow.",

Put the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with oiled cling film and set aside until doubled in size, about 1hr. Once risen, knock out the air bubbles in the dough and divide into 8 equal pieces. Using your hands, roll each piece into a long rope about 60cm long. To form into pretzels, lay the rope in a U-shape with the curve pointing towards you. Take the two ends and cross them over. Take the ends, lift them backwards and press them into the curve of the U-shape. Repeat with the remaining dough. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Carefully place the pretzels on a baking tray lined with parchment and lightly greased with oil. Cover lightly with oiled cling film. Set aside for about 20 mins until puffy (not fully risen like bread dough). Fill a medium sized saucepan with water, bring to the boil, add the baked bicarbonate of soda, then reduce the heat to a low simmer. One at a time, carefully lift the pretzels into the pan and cook for 20 secs per side. The pretzels will rise to the surface; flip with a slotted spoon. Use the spoon to gently lift the pretzels from the pan and return them to the baking tray. Once they have all been cooked in the water, lightly brush with the egg and sprinkle with flaked sea salt. Bake in the oven for 20-25 mins or until a rich, dark brown. Allow to cool on the baking tray for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

To make the icing, put the remaining chocolate bits, soured cream and 3 tbsp sugar in a small saucepan. Heat gently, stirring, until the chocolate is melted and you have a smooth icing. Chill in the fridge until firm enough to swirl on top of the muffins, then tuck in.",

Will keep chilled for three days or frozen for up to three months. Leave to cool completely first.

Brush the pie with the remaining egg yolk and season with sea salt flakes, if you like.

To make the pie lids, lay one sheet of the filo on the work surface and brush with the melted butter, then put another sheet on top. Repeat with the rest of the sheets. On the final layer, scatter over the sugar, then cut the pastry into four rectangles. Lightly scrunch each rectangle and place loosely on top of each pie dish. Bake the pies in the oven for 20 mins or until the pastry is golden and caramelised. Remove from the oven and serve.",

Leave for 1 min to wilt, stirring a couple of times so all the leaves are submerged. Tip into a large colander and place under running cold water to cool quickly. Drain well – squeeze out any excess water by pressing the spinach down with the wooden spoon, then squeezing with your hands. Using kitchen paper, pat the spinach dry into a compact shape, lay it on a board and roughly chop, then set aside. Heat 2 tsp of the oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Add the shallot, spring onions and garlic, and fry over a high-ish heat for 3-4 mins, stirring often, until softened and just starting to brown. Lower the heat, tip in the spinach and stir for 1 min only to finish drying. Season with pepper and a good pinch of nutmeg, and leave to cool. Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and put a baking sheet in to heat up. In a bowl, stir the ricotta into the beaten egg and mix in the 2 tbsp dill, the chives and mint. Season with pepper and a pinch of salt. Lightly oil a 20cm square x 4cm deep cake tin. Mix the remaining oil with the 1 rounded tsp dill. Lay the filo pastry sheets on a large board. Brush the top one with a little of the dill oil, then carefully lower it into the tin to line the base and 2 of the sides, with an overhang on both sides. The pastry doesn’t have to fit in smoothly – a few wrinkles and folds in it are fine. Brush a bit more oil over the second pastry sheet and this time lay it down in the tin the other way round, so it drapes over and lines the base and the other 2 sides. The tin should now be completely covered, with a pastry overhang all round. Repeat the criss-cross layering with 2 more oiled filo sheets. Stir the ricotta mixture into the spinach, then crumble in the feta. Lightly stir it in so you leave a few chunky pieces. Spoon this filling into the lined tin and level it. Bring the pastry sides up and over the filling, then brush a little oil over them. Brush the remainder of the oil over the last filo sheet on the board. Cut the sheet in half widthways and lay one half over at a time, in big folds, to cover the filling and give you a pastry topping. Place the tin on the heated baking sheet and bake for 25-30 mins until the pastry is crisp and golden. Leave to cool for 10-15 mins. Remove the tin and transfer to a serving plate. If your tin doesn’t have a loose bottom, carefully upturn it onto a flat board, then flip it over onto the serving plate.

Gently fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture, then add the nut and flour mixtures and carefully fold in. Set aside. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. For the filo layers, use some of the melted butter to brush the inside of a 23cm bundt tin. Lay the sheets of filo on a board and cut them in half down the middle to give you 16 strips. Take eight strips, keeping the rest covered, and brush one at a time with more butter. Arrange in the tin, making sure the inside of the ring is covered, with overhang. Repeat with the remaining filo. Dollop the cake batter evenly into the tin. Fold the overhanging filo strips inwards to cover the cake mixture, trimming off the excess. Brush the top of the filo with more butter, then prick all over using the point of a sharp knife. Bake for 25 mins or until golden. When a skewer is inserted it should come out clean with no sticky crumbs. Meanwhile, make the syrup. Put the sugar, honey, rosewater, cinnamon stick and 300ml water in a saucepan. Bring to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 5 mins. Do not stir. Pour half of the hot syrup over the baklava cake as soon as it comes out of the oven. Leave the cake to cool completely before removing it from the tin, carefully turning it out onto a lined baking sheet. Poke the top of the cake with a skewer. Return it to the oven for approximately 15 mins or until the filo is crispy and golden. Meanwhile, reheat the remaining syrup, then pour over the cake when it comes out of the oven. Leave to cool or come to room temperature before serving. Pipe rosettes of rosewater cream on top and sprinkle with chopped walnuts, pistachios and edible rose petals, if you like. Will keep for three days in the fridge.",

    "steps": "Heat a large saucepan, tip in the cumin and coriander seeds and toast for a few mins until you can smell their fragrance and they turn a shade darker, then tip into a pestle and mortar. Add the oil to the pan, then tip in the onions and cook slowly until golden and caramelised – this will take 15-20 mins. Meanwhile, bring 2 pans of water to the boil. Add the lentils to 1 pan and cook for 20 mins. Put the rice and a pinch of salt in the other pan and cook for 5 mins (it should still have a little bite). Drain both pans, and leave the lentils and rice to steam-dry. Boil the kettle. Stir the garlic into the onions and cook for 1-2 mins over a low heat. Grind the whole spices in the pestle and mortar to a fine powder and add these to the onion mixture. Grate half of the nutmeg and add to the onions with the turmeric and allspice. Put the spinach in a colander in the sink, pour over a kettle of boiling water, then rinse under cold water. Use your hands to squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Finely chop the spinach and add to the onions with the herbs, lemon zest and juice and the rice, lentils and plenty of seasoning. Leave to cool before stirring through the feta. To assemble the pie, you’ll need plenty of space on your work surface – about 1 metre. Unwrap the filo and cover with a damp tea towel. Have your bowls of melted butter and beaten egg to hand, as well as a pastry brush for each. Working quickly, lay 4 sheets of filo end to end, running along the length of your work surface, and butter each piece generously, overlapping each sheet by about 10cm. Top with another 4 sheets, butter well, then repeat with 3 final sheets of filo (save the last one to cover any cracks later on.) Spoon the rice filling down the centre of the filo, leaving 5cm free on either end. Brush the egg around the edges and tuck the ends in to cover the filling. Starting from one end, roll the filo over the filling, working your way along until you have a long filo sausage. From one end, start to coil the sausage back on itself – if the pastry cracks, patch it over the hole with your reserved piece of filo. When the coil is complete, slide onto a tray lined with baking parchment, brush the top with beaten egg and sprinkle over the sesame seeds. You can now cover it loosely with cling film and chill for up to 24 hrs. When you’re ready to bake, heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Place the pie on the middle shelf and bake for 45 mins until golden and crisp. Meanwhile, tip the ingredients for the tomato sauce into a pan, season and bubble for 30 mins until rich and thick. For the salad, halve the cucumber through the centre, then cut in half lengthways and chop into small cubes. Put in a bowl, add the remaining ingredients and season well. Set aside until ready to serve. Leave the pie to cool for 20 mins before serving with the sauce, salad and a large bowl of yogurt.",

    "steps": "Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment. Using an electric whisk, beat the butter and sugar together in a large mixing bowl until pale and fluffy. Gradually beat in the egg and vanilla extract. Stir in the flour, then knead the mixture briefly to make a dough. Divide the dough in half. One half can now be frozen or chilled to make another batch of biscuits. On a floured work surface, roll out the remaining dough to the thickness of a £1 coin. Using plain round biscuit cutters, cut out the following size biscuits: 1 x 8cm, 2x7cm, 4x6cm, 2x5cm and 1x3.5cm. Carefully transfer the biscuits to the prepared baking sheet and bake for 10-12 mins until pale golden brown. Leave them on the baking sheet for 5 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Mix the icing sugar with 2-3 tbsp water to make a smooth, spreadable icing – it shouldn’t be too runny. Spoon 1 tsp of the icing into a small bowl and mix enough yellow food colouring to make it bright yellow, then use to cover the largest biscuit and set aside to dry. Spoon 2 tsp of the white icing into another small bowl and mix in enough blue food colouring to make it a bright, light blue. Use a little of this icing to cover a 6cm biscuit to make Uranus. Set aside to dry. Add a little more blue colour to the blue icing and use a little to cover another 6cm biscuit, to make the water on the Earth. Set aside to dry. Add a little more colour to the blue icing and cover another 6cm biscuit. Using a cocktail stick, swirl a little extra blue food colour and white icing onto this iced biscuit to make Neptune. Set aside to dry. Add a little more blue and a tiny bit of black food colouring to the blue icing and spread it over the 3.5 cm biscuit to make Pluto. Set aside to dry. For Mercury, spoon 1 tbsp of the white icing into another bowl and add enough of the caramel flavouring to make a beige colour. Spread a little of it over a 5cm biscuit. Using a cocktail stick, swirl a little extra caramel flavouring into the icing on the biscuit. Set aside to dry. Spread a little of the beige icing over a 7cm biscuit. Using a cocktail stick, ￼swirl in a little red food colouring and white icing to make the patterns of Jupiter. Set aside to dry. For Saturn, add a little yellow food colouring to the beige icing and spread it over the other 7cm biscuit, leaving a 1cm border around the edge. Use a cocktail stick to swirl a little yellow food colouring into the icing and set aside to dry. For Venus, add a little orange food colouring to the beige icing and spread some over the remaining 6cm biscuit. Using a cocktail stick, swirl in a little orange. Set aside to dry. To finish Earth, spoon 1tsp white icing into another small bowl and add enough green food colouring to make it bright green. Blob a little of the green icing over parts of the blue icing. For Mars, spoon 1tsp white icing into a small bowl and add enough red food colouring to make it bright red. Spread the red icing over a 5cm biscuit. Using a cocktail stick, swirl a little red food colouring into the icing. Set aside to dry. Fit a plain nozzle to a piping bag and add the remaining white icing. Pipe 2 stripes around the middle of the Saturn biscuit to give it its rings. If you like, you can sprinkle the Mercury and Venus biscuits with a little edible gold glitter to make them sparkle.",

Put roughly a sixth of the chicken filling in the top right-hand corner in a triangular shape. Fold the opposite side of the pastry over to cover the filling. Keep flipping the encased filing down the pastry, brushing between the layers with butter as you go, to give you a triangular parcel, like a large samosa. Repeat with the remaining pastry and filling until you have 6 pastillas. Put the pastillas on a baking tray and brush the tops with egg. Bake for 25 mins until the pastry is crisp and golden.

Continue to add cold water, 1 tbsp at a time, until the mixture binds together. Be careful not to add too much. Wrap in cling film and leave to rest while you make the filling. (Alternatively you can use ready-rolled shortcrust pastry). In a large, non-stick frying pan, heat the oil, then fry the bacon. Once browned, reduce the heat, add the leeks and cook until they have softened. Mix the butter and flour into a paste and add to the pan, stirring to coat the bacon and leeks. Slowly add the milk, stirring constantly to ensure the mixture doesn’t get lumpy. Add the chicken stock and petit pois, cook for 2 mins, then add the mustard and remove from the heat. Once the chicken is cooked, remove from the oven, leave to rest briefly and carve the meat, discarding the skin and bones. Add this to the pan along with the parsley. Turn the oven up to 220C/200C fan/gas 6. Roll out two-thirds of the pastry and use to line a 25cm pie dish. Spoon your filling on top, then roll out the remaining pastry for the pie topping. Brush the edges of the pastry in the pie dish with water, then lay the top over it. Crimp and seal the edges and use any off-cuts for decoration.

Drain well, tip back into the saucepan and mix with the crème fraîche. Season, sprinkle over the nutmeg and set aside. Dust your work surface with flour, roll the first block of pastry to a circle about 28cm wide and place on a baking tray. Arrange a third of the potatoes in the middle of the pastry, then sit the cheese on top. Pile the rest of the potato around the cheese, leaving a 1cm border at the edge of the pastry. Roll the remaining pastry out to a circle about 30cm wide, dusting with more flour if needed. Brush the edges of the pastry on the tray with egg, then drape over the larger circle and seal the sides well, crimping as you go round. A tight seal is important to stop the cheese escaping. Brush all over with egg and lightly score a spiral into the pastry with the back of a knife. Bake the pie for 30 mins until golden brown and puffed up. As soon as the pie comes out of the oven, glaze with a little more egg and leave to cool for 5 mins. Meanwhile, whisk the shallot, mustard, vinegar and oil together. Place the chicory in a bowl and toss with the dressing. Serve the pie cut into oozy wedges, with the salad on the side.",

    "steps": "Sit the chicken in a large, lidded saucepan. Pour over the milk and stock, then nestle in 1 onion half and the bay leaves. Bring to a simmer over a medium heat, then cover and cook gently for 1 hr 15 mins until the chicken is cooked through – when ready, it should be opaque through the middle and the internal temperature should read 70C on a meat thermometer. Remove from the heat and leave the chicken to cool in the poaching liquid for 30mins, or until cool enough to handle. Drain, reserving 600ml of the poaching liquid, then shred the meat off the carcass using two forks. Discard the bones (or see tip, below). Finely chop the remaining onion half. Heat a deep frying pan over a medium heat and fry the pancetta for 5 mins until crisp. Add the chopped onion and fry for 10 mins more until the onion has softened. Transfer the mixture to a plate using a slotted spoon and set aside. Melt the butter in the same pan, then stir in the flour and cook for 2 mins. Pour in the wine and bring to the boil, stirring continuously. Remove from the heat and slowly whisk in the reserved poaching liquid, a little at a time. Return the pan to a medium heat and cook for 5 mins, whisking continuously until thickened. Stir through the shredded chicken, the mustard, double cream and the fried pancetta and onion. Season to taste. Spoon the mixture into a large ovenproof dish. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6. To make the topping, cook the potatoes in a pan of boiling salted water for 15 mins until easily pierced with a cutlery knife. Drain, then tip back into the pan and leave to steam-dry for 10 mins. Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the spring onions for 5 mins. Mash the potatoes with a potato masher or fork, then stir through the buttery spring onions, the milk and seasoning. Spoon the mash over the chicken filling, then scatter over the cheese and bake for 30-35 mins until the topping is golden and crisp. The unbaked pie can be kept frozen for up to a month. Defrost thoroughly in the fridge overnight, then bake as above.",

If you’re using fresh mushrooms, clean them thoroughly before using. Set a couple of the nicest-looking morels aside to decorate the top of the pie, and halve the rest. Heat half the butter in a skillet and fry the halved morels for 3-4 mins or until wilted. Scoop them onto a plate and set aside. Heat the remaining butter and gently cook the shallots in the pan with the thyme and bay. Once softened, stir in the flour and cook for 1 min or until you have a sandy paste. Pour in the sherry and sizzle, then carefully stir in the strained soaking liquid (or 200ml chicken stock if you’ve used fresh morels), followed by the crème fraîche. Season well and bring the sauce to a gentle simmer. Add the chicken and poach in the sauce for 10 mins or until the chicken is just cooked through. Remove the bay, stir through the asparagus, tarragon and fried morels, then remove from the heat. Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 8. The pastry needs to sit on top of the ingredients, so if your pan is too deep, use a pie dish instead. Roll out the pastry on a floured surface to the thickness of a £1 coin, then cut the pastry to fit the pan or dish, and drape it over the pie mixture using a rolling pin to help you. Liberally brush with egg, season the pastry with flaky sea salt, and pop your reserved morels on the top. Bake for 20 mins or until the pastry has puffed and is a deep golden brown.

Stir in the ginger and 100g/4oz each almonds and pistachios.When brown, toss in the cranberries, 2 tbsp honey, and the spinach so it wilts. Take off the heat and stir into the squash, when it comes out of the oven. Set aside. In a food processor, whizz the chickpeas with the garlic, cumin, remaining oil, lemon juice, 2 tbsp water and salt and pepper to make houmous. Stir in the coriander. Melt the butter in a small pan. Put a loose-bottomed 28cm quiche tin on a baking sheet and brush with some butter. Keeping the filo covered with a damp cloth so it doesn’t dry out, lay one sheet over half of the tin so that it hangs over the edge by about 10cm. Lay another sheet on the other side, so it overlaps the first in the centre and hangs over the opposite edge. Brush with butter. Lay two more filo sheets in the opposite direction in the same way and brush with more butter. Build up two more layers in this way, so you use a total of eight sheets of filo. Pile half the squash mixture in the centre of the pastry. Spread over the houmous and then the rest of the squash mixture.One at a time, bring the edge of each filo sheet up to the centre to cover the filling, creating voluptuous folds as you go.

      "1 egg, beaten"
    ],
    "steps": "You can make the pastry up to 2 days before. Weigh the flour into a bowl and add 1/2 tsp salt. Holding the butter by the foil (to prevent it from becoming too warm), grate it directly into the flour on the coarse side of the grater. Dip the block of butter into the flour every now and then, and mix the grated butter into the flour with a cutlery knife to prevent it clumping together in the bowl. When the butter is evenly distributed throughout the flour, pour in 100g cold water. Mix with the cutlery knife until it clumps together. Tip onto your work surface and knead briefly to bring the pastry together – don’t overwork or you’ll lose the pockets of butter, which will create the layers. Wrap in cling film and chill for at least 30 mins. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and line two baking trays with parchment. Squeeze the sausagemeat from the skins into a bowl. Add the five-spice, oyster sauce, hoisin and ginger. Mix until fully combined. Lightly flour your work surface. Roll out the pastry to the thickness of a 50p coin, then use a 10cm biscuit cutter to stamp out as many circles as you can. Fold the scraps back on themselves, but don’t scrunch up the pastry, or you’ll lose the layers. Re-roll and stamp out a few more if you can – you should make 18-20. Scoop the sausage mixture into balls (the size of cherry tomatoes) with a spoon and put in the middle of each pastry circle. Brush a little beaten egg over the pastry, then fold three sides in to partially cover the sausage and create a triangle shape, pinching the corners together. Brush more egg over the top of the pastry and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Arrange on the trays and bake for 25 mins until golden brown.

To make the pastry, put the flour in a big bowl and mix in a good pinch of salt and the cheese. Using a coarse cheese grater, grate in the butter – try to hold it as little as possible so it doesn’t warm up too much – and stir it in with a knife as you go. When all the butter is in, give it a final stir to make sure all the strands of butter are coated with flour, then quickly stir in 125ml of very cold water. Splash in a little more if it looks dry, then lightly bring the pastry together with your hands. Wrap in cling film and chill for at least 30 mins. Meanwhile, bring a big pan of water to the boil, then tip in the potatoes. Boil until just tender, then drain well, slice and allow to cool.

Arrange the potatoes, asparagus and most of the gruyère in layers in the centre of the base, leaving a border of pastry that’s roughly 5cm all the way around. Season and fold up the pastry edges to enclose the vegetables and cheese, pinching the edges to seal. Whisk together the soured cream and the egg with a little seasoning, then pour into the centre of the tart. Sprinkle over the remaining cheese and slide the tart onto the preheated baking tray.

Mix the flour and sugar with 1/2 tsp fine salt in a large bowl, then toss in the cubes of butter until coated in the flour. Splash the yeast water and lemon water over the contents of the bowl. Using a round-bladed knife, work quickly to bring the mix to a rough dough with lumps of butter held inside it. Turn onto a floured work surface, shape into a squat rectangle without kneading it too much, then wrap in cling film and chill for 15 mins in the freezer. Dust the work surface and pastry with flour. Roll the pastry in one direction until it’s 3 times long as it is wide, or about 45 x 15cm. Try to keep the sides straight as you roll, and the top and bottom edges as square as possible. Fold the pastry over itself. Fold the bottom third up, then the top third down, to make a neat block. Turn the block so that its open edge is facing to the right, like a book. Press the edges together gently with the rolling pin. Roll out and fold the pastry like this 3 more times to make a smooth dough, with the odd streak of butter here and there. If it feels greasy at any point, or becomes springy, cover and chill for 10 mins before continuing. Wrap the finished dough and chill for at least 1 hr. To make the filling, beat together all the ingredients and season with a pinch of salt. Set aside until needed. To shape, put the dough on a floured work surface. Cut it in half across the middle and return one half to the fridge. Roll the other to a 30 x 20cm rectangle, then cut this into 3 strips, each 10cm wide. To create even more layers, fold each piece in half lengthways. Put a generous teaspoon of the almond mix at one end of the pastry, then roll the pastry around it in a spiral. Place, cut-edge up, into a non-stick muffin tin. Repeat to make 6 cruffins. Loosely cover with cling film. Can be chilled overnight. (You may have some filling left over, which can be frozen.) Prove the dough at a cool room temperature for 2 hrs or until the pastry has filled the wells of the tin. Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Bake the cruffins for 20-25 mins until risen and deep golden brown. Remove and cool a little on a rack. To fill with jam, spoon the jam into a piping bag fitted with a 5mm nozzle, or use a chef’s squeezy bottle. Push the nozzle into the middle of the cruffin and squeeze. Dust the cruffins with icing sugar and eat cool or warm on the day of baking.",

    "ingredients": [
      "6 beetroots (about 750g), roughly the same size, scrubbed and trimmed but not peeled",
      "4 garlic cloves, unpeeled",
      "4 tbsp olive oil, plus 2 tsp",
      "2 tsp coriander seeds",
      "2 tsp cumin seeds",
      "5 onions, peeled, halved and finely sliced",
      "320g pack rolled all-butter puff pastry",
      "1 tbsp harissa",
      "2 tsp sherry vinegar",
      "1 egg, beaten",
      "1 tsp nigella seeds",
      "0.5 x 200g block vegetarian feta, crumbled",

    "steps": "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Rub the beetroots and garlic cloves with 2 tsp olive oil. Wrap in a double layer of foil, adding 5 tbsp water into the package. Place in an ovenproof dish and bake for 2 hrs or until tender. Test them by inserting a small sharp knife. When the beetroot is cool enough to handle, gently rub off the skins. Set aside, saving the garlic cloves. Meanwhile, heat a small frying pan. Toast the coriander seeds for a few mins until aromatic, then grind using a pestle and mortar. Toast the cumin seeds, leave them whole and mix in with the coriander. Heat 3 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan, add the onions, toasted spices and some seasoning. Cook very gently for 30 mins or until the onions are soft and golden. Unroll the pastry and cut out 4 large circles using a 12cm cookie cutter (or use a small sharp knife to score round a bowl or plate). Place the pastry circles on a baking- parchment-lined baking sheet. Gently score a 1cm border around each and prick the centre area with a fork. Bake in the oven for 10-15 mins. Meanwhile, mix the harissa, vinegar and remaining 1 tbsp olive oil in a small bowl. Thinly slice the beetroot. Remove the pastry bases from the oven and carefully press down the middle areas with the back of a spoon to flatten. Squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skins and stir into the onions. Spread this mixture evenly into the tarts, then layer on the beetroot slices in a circular pattern, slightly overlapping them. Brush the harissa mix onto the beetroot, then brush the egg on the border and sprinkle with the nigella seeds. Bake in the oven for a further 12-15 mins until the pastry is cooked and golden. To make the salad, whisk together the extra virgin olive oil, tahini, lemon juice, honey, seasoning and 1 tbsp water. Toss the chicory and watercress in the dressing. Remove the tart from the oven, scatter over the feta and serve alongside the leaves.",

    "steps": "Heat the oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Heat the oil in an ovenproof pan (one with a tight-fitting lid) or flameproof casserole dish over a high heat. Cut the ox cheek into four large chunks, then season well and toss in the flour and mustard powder. Place the pieces of meat in the hot oil – they should sizzle – and brown the meat all over. Add the onion to the pan and continue cooking until softened and starting to caramelise. Add the thyme, stock cube, porcini and some seasoning. Pour 450ml water into the pan, stirring to scrape any meaty bits off the bottom. Cover with a lid and place in the oven to cook for 3 hrs, turning the meat over in the liquid once while cooking, and topping up with a splash of water if the pan looks dry. While the meat cooks, melt the butter in a pan. Add the garlic, stir for 1 min but don’t brown, then add the mushrooms and cook for 10-12 mins until the pan is dry and the mushrooms are turning golden. Season and set aside. When their cooking time is up, scoop the ox cheeks out of the liquid and use 2 forks to shred the meat – discard any bits of fat or sinew. Strain the cooking liquid. Add 3-4 tbsp of the liquid back to the meat, along with the cooked mushrooms. Cool, then chill the meat mixture and the cooking liquid for 3 hrs, or up to 48 hrs. Roll out the pastry on a floured surface to the thickness of a £1 coin. Cut out 2 x 12cm circles and 2 x 15cm circles – use two plates to cut around if you can. Arrange the prosciutto in pairs on top of the smaller circles of pastry, in a cross shape. Split the meat mixture in half and mount each portion on top of the prosciutto. Fold the prosciutto over the meat to encase it, then flip the little parcel of meat over, so the smooth side is facing up on top of the pastry. Brush the edge of each pastry circle with a little beaten egg, then place the larger circles of pastry on top. Use your hands to create a domed centre, then crimp the edges with a fork (or your fingers) to seal in the meat. Score the pastry in a criss-cross pattern, then brush all over with beaten egg. Use any pastry scraps to cut out a heart for each pie, stick this on top and brush with egg too. Poke a steam hole on either side of each heart. Place each wellington on a square of baking parchment and chill for at least 30 mins, or up to 24 hrs. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and put a baking tray in the oven to heat up. Slide the wellingtons on their parchment onto the hot tray and bake for 30 mins. Meanwhile, reheat the cooking liquid, add the cream and peppercorns, and keep warm until ready to eat. Serve each wellington with green veg and the peppercorn gravy for pouring over.",

    "steps": "First, make the pastry. Put the flour in the bowl of a food processor. Add the butter, yeast extract and a good pinch of salt. Whizz until you have a crumbly mixture that starts to clump. Add 1 tbsp water at a time, whizzing the mixture as you do (we used 2 tbsp water in total). As soon as the dough comes together, stop the processor and don’t add more water. Tip the dough out onto a work surface and lightly roll out to the thickness of a £1 coin. Wrap and chill for 30 mins. Remove the dough from the fridge, then roll out on a lightly floured work surface until large enough to line a 20cm fluted (4cm high), loose-bottomed tart tin, with some overhang. Carefully use the rolling pin to lift the dough up and lay it into the base of the tin. Use your hands to encourage the pastry into the base and up the side of the tin, gently pushing it into the fluted edges. Leave any excess overhanging the rim. Put in the freezer for 15 mins and heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 with a baking tray on the middle shelf. Remove the pastry case from the freezer and prick the base all over with a fork. Line the inside of the case with a sheet of scrunched-up baking parchment, pressing it into the base and up the side. Pour in baking beans or dried rice or lentils to weigh the parchment down. Bake on the hot tray in the oven for 25 mins, then remove the parchment and baking beans and trim off the excess pastry using a small serrated knife. Return to the tray in the oven and bake for another 10 mins. Meanwhile, mix the eggs and the milk together in a jug with some seasoning until combined. Remove the tart case from the oven and transfer to a wire rack. Spread the piccalilli over the base, then sprinkle over the cheese and carefully pour over the egg mixture. Sprinkle with the onion seeds. Return the tart to the baking tray in the oven for 30 mins until the filling is set with a slight wobble in the centre. Leave to cool completely in the tin. Chill until cold, then cut into wedges to serve. Will keep chilled for up to three days.",

Use your rolling pin to lift it up, then drape over the tart case so there is an overhang of pastry on the sides. Using a small ball of pastry scraps, push the pastry into the corners of the tin. Chill in the fridge or freezer for 20 mins. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. In a small roasting tin, drizzle the tomatoes with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Put the tomatoes in a low shelf of the oven. Lightly prick the base of the tart with a fork, line the tart case with a large circle of greaseproof paper or foil, then fill with baking beans. Blind-bake the tart for 20 mins, remove the paper and beans, then continue to cook for 5-10 mins until biscuit brown. When you remove the tart case from the oven, take out the tomatoes, too. While the tart is cooking, beat the eggs in a large bowl. Gradually add the cream, then stir in the basil and season. When the case is ready, sprinkle half the cheese over the base, scatter over the tomatoes, pour over the cream mix, then finally scatter over the rest of the cheese. Bake for 20-25 mins until set and golden brown. Leave to cool in the case, trim the edges of the pastry, then remove from the tin. Scatter over the remaining basil and serve in slices.",

Stir in the garlic for a few further mins, until fragrant, then turn off the heat and stir in most of the thyme (save some for sprinkling). The mushroom mix can be chilled at this point. To make the tartlet bases, cut 7-8cm circles out of the bread using a cookie cutter or glass. Butter one side and stick buttered-side down into a 12-hole tartlet tin. Freeze any leftovers to make breadcrumbs. When ready to bake, heat oven to 220C/200 fan/gas 7. Divide the mushroom mixture between the tartlets and top with a sprinkle of cheese. Don’t be too tidy about this – any cheese on the tin will form a lacy edge to the tartlets. Bake for 10-15 mins until golden and bubbling. Sprinkle over the reserved herbs and serve.",

    "steps": "Line two 19 x 9 x 6cm loaf tins with baking parchment. Tip the sugar, cream, butter and glucose syrup into a medium to large saucepan. Heat to dissolve the sugar and melt the butter, stirring now and again. Once dissolved, put a sugar thermometer in the pan, making sure the measuring tip is completely immersed in the syrup – if not, transfer the mixture to a smaller pan, but be aware the syrup will bubble up. Increase the heat and bring the syrup to a steady boil. Keep bubbling, stirring occasionally to stop the sugar from catching, until the mixture reaches 116C – this is known as the soft-ball stage. Remove the pan from the heat and leave to sit undisturbed for 5 mins until the temperature drops to 110C. Stir in a good pinch of salt. Keep the sugar thermometer in the pan and begin beating the mixture with a wooden spoon, quite vigorously, until the temperature cools to about 60C. By this time the fudge will be really thick and will have lost its glossy shine. Remove the thermometer and continue beating for a few mins more. This process is important when making fudge, as it creates small sugar crystals, which give the fudge its lovely smooth and creamy texture. Working quickly, divide the mixture into 2 heatproof bowls. In one bowl, stir in the mashed banana. In the other, stir in the clementine zest, juice and 1/4 tsp of freshly ground black pepper. Before it sets, quickly pour the fudge mixes into your prepared tins and smooth over the surface. Sprinkle the cooked bacon over the top of the banana fudge. Leave both to cool at room temperature overnight – don’t put the fudge in the fridge as it will become sticky and won’t set properly. Cut into bite sized pieces and put in a box to give as a present. Banana fudge keeps in a sealed container for up to 1 week, clementine fudge for 2 weeks.",

Allow to cool. Beat the yogurt, eggs, oat milk and maple syrup into the pumpkin, then fold in the flour, raisins and baking powder until well mixed. Add a drop more milk if required. Scoop into the muffin cases and sprinkle over the pecans. Bake for 20-25 mins until risen and firm. Leave to cool and serve. Will keep chilled for up to three days in an airtight container.",

Roll out the dough on a lightly cocoa-dusted work surface, big enough to line a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin with a little overhang. Cover and chill for 30 mins. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Scrunch up a big sheet of baking parchment and use to line the tart tin. Fill with baking beans and bake for 15-20 mins until sandy and the sides are firm. Remove the beans and paper, and bake for a further 5-15 mins until really biscuity. Trim off the overhang and cool. Put the honey fudge ingredients into a small pan and warm gently until the butter has completely melted. Bring to a gentle simmer and bubble, stirring, for 4-5 mins until more golden coloured and thickened. Stir in ¼-½ tsp good salt (to taste), then pour into the tart case. Chill for 30 mins. For the topping, mix the chocolate and cream in a heatproof bowl over a pan of barely simmering water. Gently melt, stirring occasionally, until combined. Cool for 5 mins, then pour into the tart case gently, covering the honey layer. Chill until ready to serve. Remove from the fridge 10 mins before serving, to soften a little. Dust with cocoa and scatter with a little crumbled honeycomb, if you like, then serve with dollops of crème fraîche or a jug of cream.",

Divide the mixture between nine cupcake or 12 fairy cake paper cases – it’s easier if you slide these into a muffin tin as it will help them hold their shape. Leave to set. If you want them to set faster, put in the fridge for 1 hr. Drizzle with a little melted chocolate and decorate with sweets, dried fruit or nuts while they are still wet enough to stick them on. Will keep in an airtight container for five days.",

If it starts to get a little dark, tent loosely with a sheet of foil.

Remove from heat, then pour over the chocolate. Stir the chocolate and cream together until you have a smooth mixture. Add any flavourings to the truffle mix at this stage (divide the mixture between bowls and mix in liqueurs or other flavourings, a tsp at a time, to taste. Try bourbon, Grand Marnier, coconut rum or the zest and juice of an orange), or leave plain. Cool and chill for at least 4 hrs. To shape the truffles, dip a melon baller in hot water and scoop up balls of the mixture, then drop the truffles onto greaseproof paper. Or lightly coat your hands in flavourless oil (such as sunflower) and roll the truffles between your palms. You could also use a piping bag to pipe rounds onto baking parchment. Coat your truffles immediately after shaping. Tip toppings into a bowl and gently roll the truffles until evenly coated, then chill on baking parchment. Try: crushed, shelled pistachio nuts; lightly toasted desiccated coconut; or roll a truffle flavoured with orange zest and juice in cocoa powder. To coat in chocolate, line a baking tray with baking parchment. Melt 100g milk, dark or white chocolate for 10 truffles. Allow chocolate to cool slightly. With a fork, pick up one truffle at a time and hold over the bowl of melted chocolate. Spoon the chocolate over the truffle until well-coated. Place on the baking tray, then chill. To give as presents, place 8-10 truffles in individual foil or paper cases inside small, lined boxes tied with ribbon. Keep in the fridge until you’re ready to give them. Will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for three days, or frozen for up to a month. Defrost in the fridge overnight. ",

      "10g fine salt"
    ],
    "steps": "To make the sourdough starter, whisk 50g strong white flour and 50g strong wholemeal flour with 100ml slightly warm water until smooth. Transfer to a large jar or plastic container. Leave the lid ajar for 1 hr or so in a warm place, then seal and set aside for 24 hrs. For the next six days, you will need to ‘feed’ it. Each day, tip away half the original starter, add an extra 25g of each flour and 50ml slightly warm water, and stir well. After a few days, you should start to see bubbles on the surface, and it will smell yeasty. On day seven, the starter should be bubbly and smell much sweeter. It is now ready to be used, but make sure you keep half back and carry on feeding for your next loaf.  Tip both the flours, 300ml warm water and the starter into a bowl, stir with a wooden spoon into a dough and leave somewhere for an hour.  Tip in 25ml more water and the salt and bring everything together. Cover and leave somewhere warm for 3 hrs, folding the dough onto itself several times in the first hour. The dough should increase in size by about a third. Line a medium bowl with a clean tea towel and flour it really well, or flour a proving basket. Tip the dough back onto your work surface, shape into a tight, smooth ball and dust it with flour.  Place the dough, seam-side up, in the bowl or proving basket, and leave at room temperature for 3 hrs – or better still in the fridge overnight – until risen by about a quarter. Heat oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8 and put a casserole dish with a lid or a baking stone in the oven for at least 30 mins to heat up, and a large roasting tin filled with boiling water underneath. After 30 mins, carefully remove the casserole dish, invert the loaf into it and slash the top. Cover and bake for 20 mins, then take the lid off and bake for another 20 mins. Or invert onto the baking stone, slash and bake for 40 mins, or until the crust is as dark as you like it. ",

    "steps": "Tip the flour into a large bowl along with the yeast. Pour over 325g room-temperature water (you’ll get a more accurate amount by weighing the water, but you can also use 325ml, depending on your scales), then use your hands or a spatula to mix until a dough forms. It’s important that you ensure all of the flour is mixed in, including any bits around the side of the bowl. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rest for 30 mins. Sprinkle over the salt, then work it in by stretching the dough over the salt several times until fully incorporated. Tip out onto a lightly floured surface. Use the heel of one hand to stretch the dough while you hold it with your other hand. Then, fold the dough back onto itself, turn it 90 degrees to the left and repeat. Do this for about 5 mins, or until the dough looks shinier and immediately bounces back when rolled into a tight ball or gently poked. Roll the dough into a tight ball, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove at room temperature for 1 hr until doubled in size. Or, for a deeper flavour, transfer to a clean bowl, cover and leave to prove in the fridge overnight until doubled in size. Cold dough is easier to work with, so overnight is best. When the dough has doubled in size and is light and pillowy, tip it out onto a work surface and knead it a few more times to knock the air out. Gather the dough into a ball and leave to rest for 5 mins. Gently form the dough ball into a tight, rounded shape on the work surface, then tip domed-side down into a proving basket or bowl lined with a clean tea towel. Leave to prove in a warm place for 40 mins-1 hr, or in the fridge for 2-3 hrs until roughly doubled in size. Put a casserole along with its lid in the oven, then heat the oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. Once the oven is at temperature, remove the casserole. Flip the dough onto a square of baking parchment, slash it using a sharp knife and use the sides of the parchment to carefully lower the dough (still on the parchment) into the hot casserole. Cover with the lid. Bake for 25 mins. Remove the lid and bake for 5-10 mins more until it has a deeply golden, crisp crust and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Cool on a wire rack for 40 mins before slicing. Will keep in an airtight container for up to two days.",

    "steps": "The night before, make the biga (see tip, below). Stir yeast with 50ml warm water, stand for 10 mins, then add another 80ml warm water. Gradually add the flour in a stand mixer on its lowest setting. Once it’s a wet dough, transfer to a well-oiled bowl, cover and leave for 12 hours or overnight at room temperature. In the morning, combine the yeast and milk and leave to stand for 10 mins. Tip into a freestanding mixer fitted with a dough hook, add 160ml water, the biga and the olive oil. Then add the flour and 1 heaped tsp salt. Use the dough hook of a stand mixer to combine the dough. Knead for 10 mins until smooth and elastic. Don’t worry if it looks very wet, it should to be a very wet dough! Pour into a well-oiled bowl and cover with cling film. Leave to prove for an hour and a half or until doubled in size. Once rested, begin to do a series of folds – lift the dough from the edge, pull up, over, then release it. Turn the bowl 90 degrees and do the same again. Repeat so you do a full turn of the bowl twice, or 8 folds. Rest for 30 mins, then repeat the whole folding process once more. Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas mark 6. Tip the dough onto a really well-floured surface and cut in half. The dough will feel like a batter and spread across the surface a bit, but don’t panic, just work on a well-floured surface, using the flour and a pastry scraper to help move the dough. Shape the dough into 2 large squares (about 20cm x 20cm). Dealing with each loaf at a time, fold the dough in from each side, as if folding a booklet. Flip over, then pick up the roll and place each onto separate well-floured sheets of baking paper. The roll will be very soft, so oil or flour your hands well. Allow to rest for another 30 mins, covered with a floured tea towel. Don’t worry if it spreads a little. While the dough rests, heat a baking sheet in the oven. Once the dough has rested, slide each of the loaves, along with the baking paper beneath them, onto the hot baking sheet. Bake for 35-40 mins, until the crust is golden and the loaves sound hollow when tapped on the base. Move to a wire rack and cool for an hour before slicing and serving with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.",

Slowly pour 150ml boiling water from the kettle into the chocolate mixture, whisking all the time until you have a smooth ganache. (If you haven’t chopped the chocolate small enough and a few lumps remain, simply zap in the microwave for 10 seconds until smooth.) Stir in a large pinch of salt. Pour the ganache over the biscuit base and scatter with the stem ginger pieces, pistachios and a sprinkle of salt. Chill for at least 4 hrs until set, then cut into 25 bite sized squares. Can be made up to three days in advance and kept covered in the fridge. Bring out of the fridge 20 mins before serving to soften up a little.",

Add a little more salt if the mixture is too sweet. Pour over the nutty base and spread to the sides of the tin, getting the surface as smooth as possible. Chill while you prepare the topping.

Add the remaining ingredients and whizz until the mixture starts to clump together. Scrape into a bowl, then roll and cut into 18 equal sized rectangular bars, about 9 x 2cm. Place on the prepared tray and use a small palette knife to neaten the tops and sides of each biscuit. Bake for about 10 mins until lightly golden at the edges, then leave to cool. Meanwhile, put all the caramel ingredients in the food processor (no need to rinse it first) and blitz until it forms smooth, shiny clumps. Using a spatula, push the mixture together, then roll into 18 even sized balls using your hands. Once the biscuits are cool, squash the caramel onto them. Use your fingers to press it into shape and smooth out any bumps, especially around the edges (as they will show underneath the chocolate coating). Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water – make sure the water doesn’t touch the bowl (otherwise, it might seize and go grainy). Carefully dip one of the caramel-coated biscuits in the chocolate, turning it gently with a small palette knife (use this to lift it out as well). Use a spoon to drizzle over more chocolate to coat it fully. Let the excess chocolate drip into the bowl, then carefully put the biscuit back on the lined tray. Repeat with the remaining biscuits, then chill in the fridge for at least 30 mins or until the chocolate has set. Put the biscuits in an airtight container and store in the fridge.

In another bowl, mix together the sugar, egg and vanilla extract then pour it over the butter and flour mixture. Gently knead it together then separate the dough into 2 equal blocks. Knead some pink food colouring into one of them and keep the other plain. Wrap both types of dough in sheets of cling film and chill in the fridge for 20-30 mins. Roll the plain dough out onto a lightly floured surface until it’s about 25cm long and 20cm wide. Do the same with the pink dough and lay one on top of the other. Lightly roll over the surface once or twice with your rolling pin just to press them together. Trim off all the edges so they're straight then carefully roll them up from one of the short edges to make a tight spiral. Wrap tightly in cling film and chill for 1hr or overnight. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line 2 trays with baking parchment. Unwrap the dough, trim the end and cut the rest into 20 slices and lay them cut side down on your prepared baking tray. Bake for 15-17 mins or until ever so slightly golden at the very edges. Allow them to cool on the tray before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Mix the icing sugar with enough lemon juice to make it the consistency of smooth peanut butter and pour the sprinkles into a shallow bowl or plate. Dip the outside edges of the biscuits into the icing (or spread it onto the edges using the back of a teaspoon) and then into the sprinkles, turning to coat. Leave to set before serving.",

Press some clean toys gently into the biscuits, making sure you make enough of a mark without going all the way through. Re-roll off-cuts and repeat.

    "steps": "Heat the sugar, golden syrup and butter in a pan until melted. Mix the ginger and flour in a large bowl and make a well in the centre. Add the bicarbonate of soda to the melted mixture and stir – it will fizz a little – then pour into the flour mixture with the egg. Stir to combine. The mix will be soft but will firm up as it cools. Scoop the mixture into a box or fridge bag and chill for at least 1 hr until firm enough to roll out. The dough can be kept in the fridge for up to a week or frozen for three months. Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and cut in half. Briefly knead the first piece, then roll it on a lightly floured surface to 2mm thick. Cut into shapes with snowflake or star cutters about 12cm across, then transfer to lined baking sheets, leaving a little room for them to spread. Cut a window out of each biscuit using another cutter about about 6cm across, then add a sweet to the centre. If the sweets are large, chop them up first – you’ll have to judge by the size of the hole. (Don’t be tempted to add too much or it will spill over the edge.) If you plan to hang the biscuits, make a small hole in the top of each one using the end of a piping nozzle (the hole will close up a little so make sure it’s big enough). Repeat with remaining dough. Bake in batches for 5-6 mins or until they darken slightly and the sweets have melted. If the holes have closed up, remake them while the biscuits are warm. Leave to cool and harden up completely before moving them. Don’t forget to bake the parts you’ve cut out, too! You can decorate the biscuits further by using white piped icing, if you like.",

Slide the dough off the trays and put a new piece of parchment on each. Trim the edges of the dough to straighten, then cut into rectangles, roughly 6 x 3cm. Lift each one carefully onto the tray, leaving some space between them as they’ll expand. Bourbons usually have a pricked pattern, so use a cocktail stick to do this if you want (not too many or they’ll break up). Put the dough back in the freezer if it gets too soft. Bake for 8-10 mins, then leave to cool on the sheet as the biscuits will be soft when they’re hot. Sprinkle over some sugar. Will keep for a week in an airtight container. Meanwhile, make the filling. Beat the butter and icing sugar together, then divide the mixture into three. Add the cocoa to one lot, a dot of pink colour to another, and leave the last one plain (add a little more icing sugar if you need to). Spoon each into a piping bag or a sandwich bag with the corner snipped off. When the biscuits have cooled completely, pipe the icings onto half of them, then sandwich together with the other halves.

Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool – they will firm up as they cool, but still be fudgy in the centre. Will keep for up to four days in an airtight container.",

    "steps": "Melt the butter in a small saucepan until sizzling. Watch it carefully – the butter will foam, and, when the foam subsides, it will turn from yellow to a hazelnut brown. At this point, remove from the heat, tip into a bowl and leave to cool. Meanwhile, mix the flours, salt, baking powder and bicarb together in a bowl and set aside. When the butter is cool, tip in the sugars and beat with a wooden spoon to combine. Add the egg, yolks and vanilla and beat together. Scrape the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until it all comes together into a dough. Fold in the chocolate, then chill for at least 3 hrs, or until firm. Will keep chilled for up to 24 hrs. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line two large baking sheets with baking parchment. Separate the dough into 12 pieces, weighing for accuracy if you like. Roll each piece into a ball using your hands, then put six balls on each sheet, leaving space between them for spreading. Bake for 10 mins, then, one sheet at a time, remove from the oven, sprinkle with some sea salt and slam the sheet hard against your work surface. Bake for another 3 mins, then repeat the slamming of the sheet. Bake for 3 mins more. This timing will give you soft cookies, but if you prefer them a bit firmer, cook for a few minutes longer. Leave to cool on the sheets for 10 mins before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.",

Melt the chocolate in a bowl over a pan of gently simmering water, making sure that the water isn’t touching the bottom of the bowl.

      "1 tsp bicarbonate of soda"
    ],
    "steps": "Peel the pears and cut the bottom off each to give a flat base – cut them to a height that will fit snugly in your tin. Use a melon baller or small knife to cut out the pips from the base. Roughly chop the pear scraps, discarding the pips, and set aside. Tip the sugar, cinnamon, star anise, cloves, zests and 600ml water into a saucepan large enough to fit all the pears. Bring to the boil, then simmer until the sugar has dissolved. Add the pears, cover with a lid or a piece of baking parchment, and poach gently for 15 mins until a knife easily slides into a pear. Leave to cool in the liquid. Now make the sponge. Put the dates and linseeds in a saucepan and add the almond milk. Bring to a gentle simmer, then cook for 2-3 mins until the dates are soft. Pour into a food processer and blitz until smooth. Add the oil and blend again, then scrape into a bowl and set aside to cool a little. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease and line a 20 x 30cm baking tin (a loose -bottomed one if possible) with a strip of baking parchment. Put the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl with 1/ 2 tsp salt. Mix well, breaking up any lumps of sugar with your fingers, and shaking the bowl a few times to encourage any remaining lumps to come to the surface. Add the date and oil mixture, and stir well. Fold in the chopped pear scraps. Scrape the cake mixture into the tin, then nestle in the pears, standing straight up, so that the bottom halves are covered. Bake for 35-40 mins until the cake is cooked through. Insert a skewer to the centre to check – it should come out clean. If there is any wet cake mixture on the skewer, return the cake to the oven and bake for 10 mins more, then check again. Meanwhile, bring the pear poaching liquid back to the boil and simmer until reduced to a glossy syrup. When the pudding is cooked, cool for 5-10 mins, then brush all over with the syrup, saving a little extra to serve alongside, with vegan ice cream, if you like.",

Shape into a ball and put into a lightly oiled mixing bowl. Cover and leave in a warm spot to rise, for 1hr or until doubled in size. Turn the dough back onto the surface and flatten into a round. Spread the orange zest, sultanas and mixed peel onto the dough and knead again until everything is well distributed. Form into a ball, return to the bowl, cover and leave to rise for another hour. Line a large baking sheet with baking parchment. Knock the dough back by turning it out onto your surface and gently punching out the air. Divide the dough into 12 even sized pieces, weighing for accuracy if you like. Roll each one into a ball. Arrange the buns on the baking sheet, leaving a 2cm space between each one. Cover with lightly oiled cling film and leave to rise for 45 mins. Heat the oven to 220C/ 200 fan/ gas 7. To make the cross, in a small bowl, mix together the flour with 1 tbsp of water at a time to create a thick, pipeable paste. Spoon it into a piping bag fitted with a small round nozzle and pipe crosses on the buns. Transfer to the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 15-20 mins or until deep golden brown. Meanwhile, gently heat the jam in a small saucepan over a low heat to loosen. Pass through a sieve to remove any lumps. Once cooked, brush the warm jam over the tops of the buns.

Allow to cool a little, then use the sugared paper to gently roll up the sponge from the shortest edge. Leave to cool a little longer in the rolled-up shape (this will make it easier to roll up again later), then gently unroll to cool completely. Whisk the coconut yogurt or cream with the icing sugar until thickened. Once the cake is cooled, spread it with the marmalade leaving a 2cm border, then scatter with the stem ginger. Spread the coconut yogurt on top, keeping the border, then use the sheet of baking paper again to help you to roll up the sponge back into the rolled shape.

Alternatively, melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of just simmering water, ensuring the bottom of the bowl doesn’t meet the water. Leave to cool while you make the base. Blitz the digestives in a food processor, then tip into a bowl or crush in the bowl using the end of a rolling pin. Pour in the melted butter and mix until the texture resembles damp sand. Tip into the prepared tin and press down to form an even layer. Keep chilled while you make the filling.

Fold through the melted white chocolate – if it seizes, you can pop the bowl in the microwave for 10 seconds before whisking to bring it back together. Stir through 250g of the raspberries, ensuring some break up to give you a bit of a ripple. Spoon the cheesecake mix over the biscuit base and smooth to an even layer.

Using a plate or the base of a cake tin, draw a 20cm circle on each piece of parchment, then flip over so that the pencil side is facing down. Put 3 oven racks in your oven – if you only have 2 but have a large grill pan, this will work too, sat in the bottom of the oven. Put the egg whites in a large bowl, and whisk with an electric hand whisk until thick and holding soft peaks. Start adding the sugar, 1 or 2 tbsp at a time, whisking continuously. When all the sugar has been incorporated, the meringue should be thick, glossy and holding stiff peaks. Add the vinegar and whisk again briefly. Use a blob of meringue to stick down the corners of each piece of parchment to the trays. Divide the meringue between the 3 circles on the parchment, swirling it towards the outline to make thin circles. Scatter the almonds over, saving a few to serve on top once assembled. Bake for 1 hr, then leave to cool in the oven. When the oven is completely cold, remove the meringues and place somewhere cool and dry for up to 24 hrs, or assemble straight away. Toss the fruit with 1 tbsp icing sugar and set aside to macerate for 10-15 mins. Pour the cream, amaretto, almond extract and remaining icing sugar into a large bowl, and whisk until softly whipped. Use a little of the cream to stick your least successful meringue to a cake stand or plate. Spread over a third of the cream and scatter with some strawberries and cherries. Top with the remaining meringues, cream and fruit, finishing the top layer with the whole strawberries and cherries. Scatter over the remaining almonds and serve.

Stamp out rounds using a 7cm floured cutter, then place the scones on the baking tray, spaced apart. You will need to lightly squash the dough trimmings together to give you 8-9 scones in total.

Reduce to a gentle simmer, add the orange slices and cook for 1 hr-1 hr 10 mins or until the pith is translucent, turning occasionally. Line a baking tray with parchment. Carefully remove the slices from the syrup, place on the prepared tray and set aside to dry (at least 8 hrs) before cutting in half. Reserve the syrup. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Lightly grease a loaf tin (mine was 900g) with olive oil and line with a strip of baking parchment. Grind the hazelnuts in a food processor until they resemble coarse breadcrumbs (do not blitz them too much or they will become oily), then add to a bowl along with the orange zest, a pinch of salt and the flour, baking powder and cocoa. Mix together until evenly combined. Pour the oil and the orange juice into a jug and mix together. Put the eggs and sugar in a tabletop mixer or large bowl and whisk together for 5-10 mins or until the mixture has tripled in volume and holds a ribbon on the surface when the beaters are lifted out. Slowly pour the oil mixture into the egg mixture and fold together until combined. Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture in 3 or 4 additions, folding together until combined. You can’t sieve this mixture over the eggs because of the hazelnuts, but try not to dump the flour in one place – you need to be careful and fold the batter to retain its lightness. Once fully combined, pour the batter into the prepared loaf tin and bake for 50-55 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Prick the top of the cake all over, then pour over 5 tbsp of the reserved orange syrup. Cool in the tin for 15 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Trim the top of the cake (keep this for a mini trifle) and turn out, cut-side down, onto a serving platter. To decorate, pour the orange juice into a small pan and bring to a simmer. Put the chocolate in a small bowl, pour the orange juice over and stir together to form a smooth ganache. Set aside in the fridge until thickened, about 20-25 mins. Tip the hazelnuts into a small bowl and add the gold powder with a dash of water, stirring together to coat. Put the ganache in a piping bag fitted with a small round piping tip. Pipe in peaks over the top of the cake, decorating with the golden hazelnuts and the orange slices. Will keep for up to 3 days in an airtight container.",

Tip in the potatoes and cook for 10 mins, turning the mixture over every now and then. Stir in the halved tomatoes and leave to cook for 5 mins. The oat mixture should now be stiff. Work in the baking powder using your hands, then halve the mixture. With wet hands, press out one half of the mixture on a plastic chopping board to make a thin disc, like a pancake. Carefully lift it off with a palette knife and cook in a dry non-stick frying pan for 2 mins on each side. Remove to a plate, and repeat with the other half. While the second one cooks, push the potato mixture to the side in the other pan, break in the eggs and cook until the whites are set and the yolks are runny, around 2-3 mins. Serve the oat thins topped with the mushroom hash and eggs.This recipe is part of our free 7-day healthy diet plan. To access the full meal plan, click here.",

Bring the parchment up over the fish and join the two edges together by folding them over several times down the middle. Do the same with the ends and place the parcels, spaced apart, on a baking sheet. Bake for 12-15 mins, depending on how well done you like your fish, then carefully tear open the parcel.

Top with the cheese and return to the oven for 10-15 mins until the cheese starts to turn golden.

Put 6 roughly chopped garlic cloves and 50g roughly chopped ginger into the same food processor and add 4 tbsp water – process until smooth and spoon into another small bowl. Alternatively, crush the garlic to a paste with a knife or garlic press and finely grate the ginger. Heat 4 tbsp vegetable oil in a wok or sturdy pan set over a medium heat. Combine 2 tsp cumin seeds and 1 tsp fennel seeds with a 5cm cinnamon stick and 1 tsp chilli flakes and add to the pan in one go. Swirl everything around for about 30 secs until the spices release a fragrant aroma. Add the onion paste – it will splutter in the beginning. Fry until the water evaporates and the onions turn a lovely dark golden - this should take about 7-8 mins. Add the garlic and ginger paste and cook for another 2 mins – stirring all the time. Stir in 1 tsp garam masala, 1 tsp turmeric, and 1 tsp caster sugar and continue cooking for 20 secs before tipping in a 400g can chopped tomatoes. Continue cooking on a medium heat for about 10 mins without a lid until the tomatoes reduce and darken. Cut 8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs into 3cm chunks and add to the pan once the tomatoes have thickened to a paste. Cook for 5 mins to coat the chicken in the masala and seal in the juices, and then pour over 250ml hot chicken stock. Simmer for 8-10 mins without a lid until the chicken is tender and the masala lightly thickened – you might need to add an extra ladleful of stock or water if the curry needs it.

Check the aubergine is cooked by inserting a knife in the centre – if it is ready it will easily slide in and out, and the aubergine will be soft on the inside. Sprinkle the chopped parsley over the potato wedges, slice the aubergine into 2cm thick ‘steaks’ and serve on top of the potatoes. If there is no sauce in the bottom of the tin, add 3 tbsp water to loosen up the miso, then pour the miso gravy over the aubergine steaks and sprinkle with cracked black pepper.",

Stir in the pork, rosemary, mustard, garlic, some pepper to generously season, and mix well with the fork to distribute the lentils evenly. Divide the mixture into 4. Form each quarter into 5 small balls – to give you 20 in total – squeezing the mixture together well as you shape it. Lay the meatballs on the foil and roll them around in the oil to coat all over. Bake for 15 mins until cooked and lightly browned. Remove (leave the oven on) and set aside. While the meatballs cook, heat 2 tsp of the oil for the sauce in a large non-stick frying pan. Tip in the shallots and garlic, and fry on a medium heat for 3-4 mins until softened and tinged brown. Pour in the remaining 1 tsp oil, lay the tomatoes in the pan so most of them are cut-side down (to help release the juices), raise the heat and fry them for 3-4 mins or until the tomatoes are starting to soften and release their juices. Don’t stir, or they may lose their shape. Splash in 125-150ml water so it all bubbles, and gently mix in the tomato purée. Lower the heat and simmer for 2 mins to create a juicy, chunky sauce. Season with the chilli flakes, oregano, pepper and a pinch of salt, and give it a quick stir, adding a drop more water if needed – you want it thick enough to coat the meatballs. Pour the sauce into a casserole dish, add the meatballs and spoon the sauce over them to coat. Cover with foil and bake for 10 mins while you cook the spaghetti. Boil a large saucepan of water. Add the spaghetti, stir and bring back to the boil. Cook for 10-12 mins, or following pack instructions, until al dente. Drain well, season with pepper and serve with the meatballs, sauce and a light sprinkling of oregano.",

Tip into a bowl and add the wheat gluten and pea protein or protein powder. Mix to form a dough. Once it has come together, give it a really good knead, stretching and tearing for 10-15 mins. It will be ready when the seitan feels springy. Pour the veg stock into a pan with the onion, garlic and parsley stalks. Bring to a simmer. Flatten out the seitan to 1cm in thickness, and chop into chicken-breast-sized chunks. Simmer these in the stock for 30 mins, covered with a lid. Allow to cool in the stock. Ideally do this the day before and chill in the fridge. These can also be frozen if you wish. Mix the spice coating ingredients in one bowl. Place the gram flour in another and the plain flour in a third. Mix enough water into the gram flour until it has a texture similar to beaten egg. Dip the seitan pieces in the plain flour, shake off the excess, then coat each piece in the gram flour mixture and finally in the panko spice mix. In a large frying pan or deep fat fryer, heat the oil to 180C (or until a piece of bread browns in 20 seconds). Once it's hot, carefully drop in the seitan pieces and cook for 6 mins or so, until they are dark golden brown and crispy. Transfer to kitchen paper to drain off the excess oil and sprinkle with a little salt. Serve in toasted buns with salad or slaw, or alternatively as mock chicken dippers with BBQ sauce.",

(No need to wash the pan, you can use it later.) Meanwhile, put 4 of the eggs in a medium pan, covering well with cold water. Bring to the boil – as the water starts to bubble, set the timer and boil for 5 mins. When cooked, pour off the boiling water and cool the eggs under cold water to stop them from cooking further. Mash the lentils well in a medium bowl with the back of a fork, then stir in the pork mince, sage, 2 tsp of the chives, the mustard, nutmeg, cooled shallots, a pinch of salt and a generous grating of black pepper. Peel the shells from the eggs and pat dry with kitchen paper. Divide the meat mix evenly into 4. Tip the flour onto a plate and roll in each egg to coat, tapping off any excess. Pat down a quarter of the meat mix on the work surface to a 12-13 cm circle, using the rest of the flour to keep it from sticking. Cup the circle in your hand and place one of the eggs in the centre. With both hands, pat, press and ease the meat mix around the egg until it is completely and evenly covered. Seal really well so there is no join, then pat and roll it into a good shape on the floured surface. Repeat with the rest of the meat mix and cooked eggs. Mix the panko crumbs on a large plate with the remaining chives. Beat the remaining egg on a plate, brush some all over each coated egg (you won’t use it all), then roll the eggs in the panko crumbs, patting them on to stick. Lay the eggs on a baking parchment-lined baking tray and chill for 20-25 mins (but not overnight). Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Heat 2 tsp of the remaining oil in the pan you used for the shallot. When quite hot (it is hot enough when a few panko crumbs dropped in sizzle immediately and start to brown), put in 2 of the scotch eggs and roll in the oil to coat them well. Set the timer for 2 mins, then fry, turning often, to brown all over. You are just browning, not fully cooking the eggs at this stage, so don’t overcook or the coating may start to split. Transfer to the lined baking tray and repeat with the remaining eggs, lowering the heat slightly if the pan gets too hot. Bake the scotch eggs for 12 mins. Remove and lay them on kitchen paper to drain and leave to cool slightly. Halve the scotch eggs using a sharp knife and serve slightly warm or cold. Best eaten the same day or, when cold, can be stored overnight in the fridge in an airtight container.",

Drain the onion well and mix it into the batter. Heat about 5cm of oil in a wok or deep pan. Do not fill the pan more than a third full. Add a tiny speck of batter. If it rises to the surface surrounded by bubbles and starts to brown, then the oil is hot enough for frying. Lower heaped tbsps of the bhaji mixture into the pan, a few at a time, and cook for a few mins, turning once, until they are evenly browned and crisp, so about 3-4 mins. Drain on kitchen paper, sprinkle with a little salt and keep warm while you cook the rest. Serve with the raita.",

    "steps": "Tip the oats and soya milk into a large bowl and blitz using a hand blender to break down the oats to a less coarse texture. Set aside for 10 mins to soak. Meanwhile, boil the potatoes for 5 mins, then drain. Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, and cook the mushrooms, onion and paprika for a few minutes until softened. Tip in the potatoes and cook for 10 mins, turning the mixture over every now and then. Stir in the halved tomatoes and leave to cook for 5 mins. The oat mixture should now be stiff. Work in the baking powder using your hands, then halve the mixture. With wet hands, press out one half of the mixture on a plastic chopping board to make a thin disc, like a pancake. Carefully lift it off with a palette knife and cook in a dry non-stick frying pan for 2 mins on each side. Remove to a plate, and repeat with the other half. Put the oat thins on two plates and top with the hash to serve.This recipe is part of our free 7-day healthy diet plan. To access the full meal plan, click here.",

If you’re making the crackling, lay the chicken skin on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment and sprinkle with sea salt. Put another piece of baking parchment on top, then weigh it down with a baking tray. Roast for 25-30 mins until crisp and golden. Meanwhile, trim the crusts off the sourdough and tear the centre into pieces. Tip onto a baking tray, drizzle with the rest of the olive oil and finely grate over 15g of the parmesan. Toss everything together so the bread is completely coated in oil and cheese. Bake in the oven for 15-25 mins with the crackling (if making), tossing a few times, until golden and crunchy. The croutons and crackling can be prepared a day ahead and kept in an airtight container. For the dressing, use a pestle and mortar to crush the remaining garlic to a paste, then mash in the anchovies. Spoon into a bowl and finely grate in 10g parmesan, then add the remaining lemon juice, mayo and mustard. Gradually stir in 4 tbsp oil. Can be made three hrs ahead. Heat a griddle pan until smoking. Griddle the chicken for 4-5 mins on each side until just cooked, then set aside. Trim and discard any limp outside lettuce leaves and trim the rest into bite sized lengths. Slice the chicken into pieces and use a peeler to shave the remaining parmesan, grating the final stump that can’t be shaved. To serve, tip the lettuce, croutons, chicken and cheese into a large salad bowl and drizzle with most of the dressing.

    "steps": "To spatchcock the chicken, flip it over so the backbone is facing you. Using a sturdy pair of kitchen scissors, cut down either side of the backbone, then discard. Turn the chicken over and push down firmly on the breastbone to flatten it out, then make a few slashes in each leg joint. (Or you can ask your butcher to spatchcock the chicken for you.) Put the chicken in a large sealable plastic bag, or a dish. Next, make the marinade. Rinse the preserved lemon under running water to remove some of the brine, then separate the middle from the peel (the middle part – the flesh and pips – is very sour) and discard the middle. Finely chop the soft peel until it resembles a paste. Tip into a bowl and add the remaining marinade ingredients and a pinch of salt. Whisk until combined, then pour roughly half the marinade over the chicken and rub it into all the nooks. For the best flavour, leave the chicken to marinate overnight, covered, in the fridge (store the remaining marinade in the fridge too), but if you’re short on time, 2 hrs marinating will do. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Tip the onions and beetroot into a large roasting tin (use your best tin and you can serve the dish straight from it), drizzle with oil and season well. Toss the vegetables to coat and spread them out towards the edges of the tin. Place the chicken on top, skin-side up, and pour over any juices from the bag or dish. Season the chicken well and roast for 45 mins. Meanwhile, bring a pan of water to the boil and add the spelt. Cook for 20 mins or until tender, then drain and set aside. Halve each avocado, remove the stones and peel. Chop each piece in half again, if you like. Char the avocado pieces on a hot griddle pan for a few mins – this will give it a smoky flavour. Remove the remaining marinade from the fridge and very gently toss the avocado pieces in it, then set them aside. Pour the remaining marinade into a small pan and bring to a rapid boil, then continue cooking for 2-3 mins until you have a sticky glaze. Remove the roasting tin from the oven, lift the chicken onto a plate or board and stir the spelt into the vegetables. Place the chicken back on top, dot the avocado pieces around the tin and brush the thickened glaze over the chicken. Return to the oven for a further 5-10 mins. To check the chicken is cooked, pierce the thickest part with a skewer. The juices should run clear, not pink. If you need to, return the chicken to the oven for a further 5-10 mins, then check again. Lift the chicken onto a plate, cover loosely with foil and return the roasting tin with the vegetables to the oven for a further 10 mins until the avocado starts to soften. To serve, nestle the chicken back into the tin of veg, scatter over a few small watercress leaves and serve the rest on the side with the yogurt.",

Bake for 8-10 mins, turning the croutons a few times during cooking so they brown evenly. Rub 2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts with 1 tbsp olive oil, season. Place pan over a medium heat for 1 min, until hot, but not smoking. Lay the chicken on the pan (it will sizzle if it’s hot enough) and leave for 4 mins. Turn the chicken, then cook for 4 mins more. Check if it’s cooked by poking the tip of a sharp knife into the thickest part; there should be no sign of pink and juices will run clear. Bash 1 garlic clove with the flat of a knife and peel off the skin. Crush with a garlic crusher. Mash 2 anchovies with a fork against the side of a small bowl. Grate a handful of parmesan cheese and mix with the garlic, anchovies, 5 tbsp Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise and 1 tbsp white wine vinegar. Season to taste. It should be the consistency of yogurt – if yours is thicker, stir in a few tsps water to thin it. Shave the cheese with a peeler. Tear 1 large cos or romaine lettuce into large pieces and put in a large bowl. Pull chicken into bite-size strips and scatter half over the leaves, along with half the croutons. Add most of the dressing and toss with your fingers. Scatter the rest of the chicken and croutons, then drizzle with the remaining dressing. Sprinkle the parmesan on top and serve straight away.",

Once baked, rub with the raw garlic and break or cut into croutons. Bring a pan of water to boil. Add the potatoes, mint and 1 tsp salt and simmer for 15 mins until the potatoes are tender. Don’t be afraid of overcooking them – they’re far better tender than chalky. Drain the potatoes and discard the mint sprig. Meanwhile, bring another pan of water to the boil and lower the eggs into the water. Bring back to the boil and cook for 6 mins. Drain, then run the eggs under cold water to cool. Tap the eggs on the work surface and peel. Bring another pan of salted water to the boil. Chop the asparagus spears into three and boil in the water for 3-4 mins until just tender. Scoop out with a slotted spoon and refresh in cold water. Bring the water back to the boil and add a pinch of sugar. Add the peas to the water and cook until tender (about 2-3 mins). Drain. Toss the potatoes with 2 tbsp mayo and the apple, spring onions and capers. Whisk the olive oil and white wine vinegar together, season, then dress the lettuce and soft herbs along with the asparagus and peas. Spread the remaining mayo across your plate, top with the potatoes and dressed salad, halve the eggs and add more mayo, if you like. Garnish with the croutons and extra herbs.Homemade mayoIn a large bowl, whisk 2 egg yolks, ½ tsp salt, 1 tsp Dijon mustard and the juice of ½ lemon. Still whisking, add 200ml vegetable oil a drop at a time, increasing to a stream once it starts emulsifying. If it splits, just add a squeeze of lemon and whisk vigorously – it will come together. Add 100ml extra virgin rapeseed oil, whisking, to finish the mayo, then add 2 tbsp water, a pinch of cayenne pepper and a pinch of white pepper. Whisk until creamy.",

Bake for 1-2 hrs until completely tender right through – the time will depend on the size of the beets. To make the dressing, combine the vinegar and mustard in a jug, then season. Add the remaining ingredients and whisk until amalgamated. Put the lentils in a pan with the stock, bay and thyme. Bring to the boil, then turn down to a very gentle simmer. Cook for 12-15 mins until the lentils are just tender. The stock will be absorbed as the lentils cook (if this happens before the lentils are ready, just add some boiling water). Drain the lentils (if there is any liquid left) and set aside. Fill a bowl with water and add the lemon juice. Peel the celeriac and cut it into matchsticks, dropping them into the acidulated water to stop the flesh discolouring. Steam or boil the celeriac until just tender. Peel the cooked beets and cut the flesh into small wedges or matchsticks. Drain the celeriac and pat dry. Discard the bay and toss the lentils with the celeriac, hazelnuts, parsley and most of the dressing. Season to taste, then transfer to a serving dish. Season the beets and add them to the salad, spooning the rest of the dressing over the top.",

Put the chorizo in a cold frying pan and fry over a medium heat until crisp – you should collect lots of oil in the pan. Lift out the chorizo with a slotted spoon and keep warm.

If there isn't, add a little more hot water. Remove the casserole from the oven and allow to cool slightly. Using a fork and your fingers, finely shred the chicken into a bowl. Add the mushrooms, garlic and all the juices from the casserole. Mix well and season. To serve, sprinkle the salad leaves into the mushroom and chicken mixture and gently toss them through so they just wilt a little in the warmth. Serve the salad in a large bowl or on a platter, with some garlic bread on the side.",
